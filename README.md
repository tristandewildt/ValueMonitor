# ValueMonitor
ValueMonitor is a tool that can be used by all to analyse how moral values have changed over time. Analyses are done based on text corpora, using a text-mining method called probabilistic topic models. Specific to topic models is that values are not defined as keywords, but as distribution of words. This is useful to better capture the idea of (latent) values.
