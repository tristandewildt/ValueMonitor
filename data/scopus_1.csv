Yet, heat-electricity integration may be challenged, in practice, by the large variability of heat demand across weather years. Current approaches for residential heat demand simulation fail to provide insights about the extent of such variability across many weather years and about the benefits potentially brought about by nearly zero-energy buildings. To fill this gap, this work develops an open-source space-heating demand simulation workflow that is applicable to any country's building stock. The workflow, based on a well-established lumped-parameter thermodynamic model, allows capturing sub-national weather-year variability and the mitigation effects of refurbishment. For Italy, different weather years lead to variations in heat demand up to 2 TWh/day, lasting for several days. Moreover, some weather regimes produce spatial asymmetries that may further complicate heat-electricity integration. The refurbishment of about 55% of buildings constructed before 1975 could substantially mitigate such oscillations, leading to a 31–37% reduction of yearly heat demand, primarily in colder regions. Intra-day heat demand variations, driven by user behaviour, are not substantially impacted by refurbishment, calling for the simultaneous deployment of flexible heat generating technologies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Energy modelling; Heat demand simulation; Lumped-parameter approach; Nearly zero energy buildings; Weather regimes,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116071175

Traditional LCAs analyze well defined and developed industrial systems, but recent developments of LCA focus on analyzing emerging technologies which are not yet optimized with respect to energy and materials. Therefore, LCA results of ex-ante applications can be very different from ex-post applications for the same system. The purpose of this study is to show the different effects of data scales on LCA results regarding global warming, fine particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification and freshwater eutrophication potentials. For this purpose torrefaction technology was selected as the case study and assessed based on bench scale data, lab scale data, data derived from process simulations, pilot scale data and commercial scale data. Considered environmental impacts were global warming, fine particulate matter formation, terrestrial acidification and freshwater eutrophication. Results showed that process efficiencies improved significantly between the bench scale system and systems with higher technology readiness levels (TRLs), such as pilot, process simulations and commercial scale systems. Furthermore, process simulations result in scores closer to commercial scale regarding all considered environmental impacts. However, if LCA practitioners focus only on global warming impact, then pilot scale is also a good alternative. Finally, due to torrefaction technology being relatively simple in terms of raw materials input, we suggest more complex chemical systems to be assessed with LCA in various TRLs. © 2021",Ex post LCA; Ex-ante LCA; Global warming; Technology readiness level; Torrefaction,Acidification; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Global warming; Particles (particulate matter); Sustainable development; Water; Environmental assessment; Ex antes; Ex post life cycle assessment; Ex-ante life cycle assessment; Fine particulate matter; Particulate matter formations; Pilot scale; Process simulations; Technology readiness levels; Torrefaction; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115015414

Especially younger visitors are underrepresented. Previous research emphasizes the importance of providing new, potentially interested audiences with more means to consume the music. This paper presents an exploratory case study with the persuasive game Listening Space which we developed to help attract new audiences and thus preserve Western classical music heritage. In particular, we studied to what extent this game could promote more varied ways of listening to classical music and thus enrich the experience of visiting a classical music concert. We designed and executed a controlled randomized trial with surveys before and after the experiment as well as a series of in-depth interviews with participants after the experiment. Our treatment group consisted of 139 participants (both new and existing visitors). They played our digital game at their own convenience, followed by a visit to a concert in a renowned classical music concert hall. A control group of 165 participants only visited the concerts. We measured the effects of the game - changes in the ways participants listen to classical music - through self-report in questionnaires before and after the experiment. Results show that Listening Space seems most effective for new audiences: the game promoted more varied ways of listening in the treatment group and thus enriched their experience of visiting a classical music concert. The control group of new visitors did not show an effect and also no differences were found between the treatment and control groups of regular visitors of classical music concerts We employed regression analysis to identify predictors of the game's effect on listening styles: participants' age and their level of appreciation of the classical music genre were negatively related to the effectiveness of the game. The way in which participants experienced the game also significantly influenced the effectiveness. This case study shows the potential of using games to promote classical music concerts: games seem to be valuable in attracting new, young audiences and, therefore, represent powerful instruments to help preserve Western classical music cultural heritage. © 2021 Owner/Author.",case study; classical music; Cultural heritage; digital game; persuasive gaming,Historic preservation; Music; Regression analysis; Surveys; Case-studies; Classical musics; Control groups; Cultural heritages; Digital games; Exploratory case studies; Netherlands; Persuasive gaming; Randomized trial; Treatment group; Computer games,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116503019

This problem has raised the need to better understand factors contributing to seatbelt use, particularly in multi-occupant vehicles. Among these factors, behavioural determinants of seatbelt use are difficult to measure and their data are not readily available. These behavioural factors may have shared influences on vehicle occupants, causing their seatbelt use choices to be correlated. These complexities have prevented a comprehensive understanding of seatbelt use choices in the literature. This study aims to fill this gap by developing an econometric model that explains seatbelt use choices in multi-occupant vehicles. A set of binary logit models are constructed for seatbelt use choices and their utilities are correlated across vehicle occupants. A new latent variable representing the unobserved factors or ‘atmosphere’ of the vehicle is then incorporated into the model. The model is empirically tested using seatbelt use data from Tennessee, United States. Results indicate that vehicle body type and time of the day are significantly associated with seatbelt use. In addition, the collective seatbelt use in a vehicle is influenced by the unobserved atmosphere in the vehicle. Age, alcohol and drug consumption, higher proportion of old population and white racial mix, higher income per capita, and higher education levels are factors contributing to this latent atmosphere. © 2021 The Authors",Bayesian inference; Endogeneity; Integrated choice and latent variable; Seatbelt use,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115971916

As research on the PI concept is still young, the functioning of maritime ports in the context of the PI is still underexplored. Our aim is to contribute to the scientific debate about radically different futures for maritime ports around the world, by identifying their possible future development paths towards the PI. We construct an evolutionary port development framework that identifies the main dimensions of the PI in relation to ports, including governance, operational, and digital aspects. To design the future development paths towards the PI, we conducted a scenario analysis and used a Delphi survey amongst port development and PI experts. The resulting expectation is that a fully globally functioning of the PI may not be reached by 2040. Also, our analysis shows that global governance of FTL systems is critical for the pace of development and adoption. Building on the identified potential future development paths, we provide a discussion, relevant for port authorities and other stakeholders, as well as avenues for future research. © 2021 The Authors",Delphi study; Freight transport; Logistics; Maritime ports; Physical Internet; Scenario development,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115935938

Soon, research dispersed into new, specialized fields, such as foresight, sense-making, and entrepreneurial alertness. Each field used different terms for weak signals and framed the research in its own theoretical and methodological basis, which led to many different descriptions of weak signals. To put a stop to the growing number of definitions, this paper presents a contrarian approach. The usual simple combinations are likely to omit relevant meaning when underlying definitions only partially overlap. Therefore, his paper used a three-step approach including cluster analysis to unify 68 reviewed definitions into one. Cluster analysis includes more meaning by summarizing data. The analysis resulted in the defining of weakness in terms of distance to a perceiver's frame of reference. Distance explains the difficulty of perceiving weak signals more clearly than keywords like novel, ambiguous, or ill-defined. Distance also helps to quantify the amount of weakness in signals. Our approach may help others to find clarity and retain meaning when constructs are fuzzy. Defining weakness in distance opens up comparative studies between signals of various levels of weakness. © 2021 The Authors",Definition development; Foresight; Top managers; Weak signals,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114933372

This study addresses coordination and conflict management in a three-level FSC that embraces a new inventory type known as growing items like poultry and livestock. The chain involves a rearing farm as the supplier, a processed food producer as the manufacturer, and multiple processed food retailers. Vendor Managed Inventory (VMI) is applied by the manufacturer to handle the retailers' systems and prevent replenishment mismatches and thereby food waste. To increase its market coverage, the manufacturer needs to provide the retailers with enough incentives to enter this setting. So, a cost-sharing contract is designed under which the manufacturer undertakes a fraction of the retailers’ holding costs. Accordingly, the manufacturer faces two contradictory targets, increasing its market coverage by convincing the retailers to enter the system on the one hand and managing its costs efficiently on the other hand. An analytic solution approach with a game-theoretic perspective is developed to solve the model. Extensive numerical experiments and a case study are provided, presenting fruitful managerial insights that can be utilized by the policymakers and chain members under different settings. The results highlight the efficiency of our VMI and cost-sharing collaboration scheme in enhancing the performance of the chain. © 2021 The Author(s)",Coordination; Cost-efficiency; Food supply chain; Growth; Market coverage; Vendor managed inventory,Agriculture; Costs; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Food supply; Game theory; Manufacture; Sales; Supply chains; Coordination; Cost-efficiency; Coverage efficiencies; Critical issues; Food supply chain; Market costs; Market coverage; Supply chain coordination; Trade off; Vendor managed Inventory; Cost effectiveness,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114914678

In this contribution we complement this functional view with an institutional view, that takes data analysis and domain professionalism as complementary (yet fallible) knowledge sources. We developed a framework that identifies and amplifies synergies between data analysts and domain professionals instead of taking one of them (i.e. data analytics) at the centre of the analytical process. The framework combines the often-cited CRISP-DM framework with a knowledge creation framework. The resulting framework is used in a data science project at a Dutch inspectorate that seeks to use data for risk-based inspection. The findings show first support of our framework. They also show that whereas more complex models have a higher predictive power, simpler models are sometimes preferred as they have the potential to create more synergies between inspectors and data analyst. Another issue driven by the integrated framework is about who of the involved actors should own the predictive model: data analysts or inspectors. © 2021",Data science; Knowledge; Predictive model; Professionalism; Risk-based inspection; Value creation,Data Science; Data analysts; Data domains; Data driven; Data generation; Knowledge; Knowledge creations; Predictive models; Professionalism; Risk-based inspection; Value creation; Data Analytics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114129758

These systems are becoming more connected to the internet, either directly or through the corporate networks. This makes them vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Abnormal behaviour in floodgates operated by ICS could be caused by both (intentional) attacks and (accidental) technical failures. When operators notice abnormal behaviour, they should be able to distinguish between those two causes to take appropriate measures, because for example replacing a sensor in case of intentional incorrect sensor measurements would be ineffective and would not block corresponding the attack vector. In the previous work, we developed the attack-failure distinguisher framework for constructing Bayesian Network (BN) models to enable operators to distinguish between those two causes, including the knowledge elicitation method to construct the directed acyclic graph and conditional probability tables of BN models. As a full case study of the attack-failure distinguisher framework, this paper presents a BN model constructed to distinguish between attacks and technical failures for the problem of incorrect sensor measurements in floodgates, addressing the problem of floodgate operators. We utilised experts who associate themselves with the safety and/or security community to construct the BN model and validate the qualitative part of constructed BN model. The constructed BN model is usable in water management infrastructures to distinguish between intentional attacks and accidental technical failures in case of incorrect sensor measurements. This could help to decide on appropriate response strategies and avoid further complications in case of incorrect sensor measurements. © 2021, The Author(s).",Bayesian network; DeMorgan model; Intentional attack; Probability elicitation; Safety; Security; Technical failure; Water management,Bayesian networks; Directed graphs; Hydraulic gates; Network security; Water management; Abnormal behaviours; Bayesian network models; Conditional probability tables; Directed acyclic graph (DAG); Industrial control systems; Intentional Attacks; Management infrastructure; Response strategies; Floods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113988932

The monetary value of this behaviour can be obtained by asking pedestrians about their perception of the “fine” for blocking the path of a fully automated vehicle. Econometric modelling of the reported fine can shed more light on factors influencing pedestrians’ receptivity towards fully automated vehicles. However, development of such an econometric model is not straightforward due to the unique characteristics of the dependent variable: it has two fundamentally different states; it is right-truncated; and it may be fat-tailed. Despite fairly extensive methodological advancements in econometric modelling of pedestrian behaviour, there is no model that can adequately explain these characteristics. While a beta distribution in a hurdle setting has the potential to address the above complexities, its applicability in dealing with limited dependent variables in transport applications has remained, by and large, unexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by developing a new beta hurdle regression model that systematically considers the dual-state of a right-truncated dependent variable representing the fine associated with intentionally blocking a fully automated vehicle. The hypothesized model is empirically tested using data obtained from a survey administered in Queensland, Australia, and the results are compared with truncated lognormal, and truncated lognormal hurdle regression models. Results indicate that the hurdle models are superior to the non-hurdle model. The beta variant of the hurdle model provides a better statistical fit for the data that are near their right limit. In addition, parametrizing the variance of the beta distribution captures the additional heterogeneity in the data. Age, gender, education level, violations, attitudes, behaviours that appease social interactions, and perceived ease or difficulty of interacting with fully automated vehicles influence the likelihood and/or the propensity of the fine and thus are associated with the perceived monetary value of intentionally blocking the path of a fully automated vehicle. © 2021 The Author(s)",Beta distribution; Fully automated vehicles; Hurdle regression; Pedestrian receptivity; Truncated regression,Automation; Regression analysis; Vehicles; Beta distributions; Dependent variables; Econometric model; Econometric modelling; Perceived monetary values; Random parameters; Social interactions; Transport applications; Pedestrian safety,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113420263

The number of COVID-19 patients increases rapidly every day. The hospitals across many countries are starving to provide adequate service to the patients due to the shortage of resources and as a consequence, patients do not get admitted to hospitals on time, which in turn creates panic and might contribute to the spread of the pandemic. Under this resource constraint situation, this study proposes a data-driven optimization model for patient allocation in hospitals. First, a compartmental model is developed for characterizing the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Then, Pareto analysis is carried out to identify the most COVID-affected cities. An optimization model is then developed for optimal patient allocation in hospitals in different cities. Finally, a sensitivity analysis is also conducted to investigate the robustness of our decision model. Using published data for Indian cities, obtained from different websites, the proposed methodology has been validated. Experimental results reveal that the proposed model offers some efficient strategies for optimal allocation of patients. A total of ten cities are identified as the most affected. Besides, four factors, namely cooperation, distances between cities, number of patients, and bed capacity per city emerge as important determinants. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",Compartmental model; COVID-19; Data-driven decision making; Optimization model; Pareto analysis; Patient allocation in India,Hospitals; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Viruses; Compartmental modelling; COVID-19; Data driven decision; Data-driven decision making; Data-driven optimization; Decisions makings; Healthcare systems; Optimization models; Pareto analysis; Patient allocation in india; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85115344997

To improve its integration, the recent regulation of the European Union introduces a common standalone balancing energy market. It allows actors that have not participated or not been awarded in the preceding balancing capacity market to participate as voluntary bidders or ‘second-chance’ bidders. We investigate the effect of these changes on balancing market efficiency and on strategic behavior in particular, using a combination of agent-based modelling and reinforcement learning. This paper is the first to model agents' interdependent bidding strategies in the balancing capacity and energy markets with the help of two collaborative reinforcement learning algorithms. Results reveal considerable efficiency gains in the balancing energy market from the introduction of voluntary bids even in highly concentrated markets while offering a new value stream to providers of short-term flexibility. ‘Second-chance’ bidders further drive competition, reducing balancing energy costs. However, we warn that this design change is likely to shift some of the activation costs to the balancing capacity market where agents are prompted to bid more strategically in the view of lower profits from balancing energy. As it is unlikely that the balancing capacity market can be removed altogether, we recommend integrating European balancing capacity markets on par with balancing energy markets and easing prequalification requirements to ensure sufficient competition. © 2021 The Author(s)",Balancing market; Bidding strategy; Machine learning; Market design; Market efficiency; Regulation,Autonomous agents; Balancing; Computational methods; Energy efficiency; Learning algorithms; Reinforcement learning; Balancing energy; Balancing market; Bidding strategy; Capacity markets; Energy markets; Machine-learning; Market design; Market efficiency; Regulation; Short term; Power markets; electricity supply; energy balance; energy market; European Union; machine learning; regulatory framework,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113367373

However, the criteria for identifying and diagnosing safety risks in complex social contexts remain unclear and contested. In this paper, we examine the vagueness in debates about the safety and ethical behavior of AI systems. We show how this vagueness cannot be resolved through mathematical formalism alone, instead requiring deliberation about the politics of development as well as the context of deployment. Drawing from a new sociotechnical lexicon, we redefine vagueness in terms of distinct design challenges at key stages in AI system development. The resulting framework of Hard Choices in Artificial Intelligence (HCAI) empowers developers by 1) identifying points of overlap between design decisions and major sociotechnical challenges; 2) motivating the creation of stakeholder feedback channels so that safety issues can be exhaustively addressed. As such, HCAI contributes to a timely debate about the status of AI development in democratic societies, arguing that deliberation should be the goal of AI Safety, not just the procedure by which it is ensured. © 2021 The Authors",AI ethics; AI governance; AI regulation; AI safety; Philosophy of artificial intelligence; Sociotechnical systems,Philosophical aspects; Design challenges; Design decisions; Ethical behavior; Mathematical formalism; Social context; Social domains; Sociotechnical; Stakeholder feedbacks; Artificial intelligence,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111540061

The disruption, such as an intentional attack, may be difficult to predict and prevent, thus developing a resilient HAZMAT storage plant may be a practical and effective way to deal with these disruptions. This study develops a dynamic stochastic methodology to quantify the resilience of HAZMAT storage plants. In this methodology, resilience evolution scenarios are modeled as a dynamic process that consists of four stages: disruption, escalation, adaption, and restoration stages. The resistant capability in the disruption stage, mitigation capability in the escalation stage, adaption capability in the adaption stage, and restoration capability in the restoration stage are quantified to obtain the HAZMAT storage resilience. The uncertainties in the disruption stage and the mitigation stage are considered, and the dynamic Monte Carlo method is used to simulate possible resilience scenarios and thus quantify the storage resilience.

Using the multi-level governance theory complemented with the notion of informal governance, the analysis explains the decision-making that defined a State-aid scheme to public transport operators following a process of consultation and concertation between state and non-state actors across governance tiers. To agree on a financial rescue package, these actors engage in front-stage and back-stage political interactions, constrained and enabled by formal and informal governance structures and practices. By analyzing how the interplay between the political mobilization of actors, policy-making arrangements, and existing polity structures shapes political alignment around the financial support scheme, the paper concludes that the crisis did not change customary governance and policy-making practices. Stakeholders sought their usual partners and followed existing routines in path-dependent ways to address the policy challenge brought by Covid-19. Despite being triggered by a major exogenous shock, the policy response to the crisis was driven mainly by endogenous forces; the decision-making mechanism remained the same and the network of actors did not shrink or expand. © 2021 The Author(s)",Covid-19; Decision-making; Financial crisis; Informal governance; Multi-level governance; State-aid,COVID-19; decision making; disease control; financial crisis; governance approach; policy approach; policy making; public transport; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113301761

To demonstrate and test the novel approach, we use the classic shallow lake problem. We compare the results obtained with the novel approach to those obtained with previously used approaches. We show that the novel approach guarantees the feasibility and robust efficiency of the produced solutions under all selected scenarios, while decreasing computation cost, addresses the scenario-dependency issues, and enables the decision-makers to explore the trade-off between optimality/feasibility in any selected scenario and robustness across a broader range of scenarios. We also find that the lake problem is ill-suited for reflecting trade-offs in robust performance over the set of scenarios and Pareto optimality in any specific scenario, highlighting the need for novel benchmark problems to properly evaluate novel approaches. © 2021 The Authors",Deep uncertainty; Multi-objective optimization; Reference points; Robust decision making scalarizing functions; Scenario planning,Benchmarking; Economic and social effects; Lakes; Multiobjective optimization; Pareto principle; Deep uncertainties; Multi objective; Multi scenarios; Multi-objectives optimization; Posteriori; Reference points; Robust decision making scalarizing function; Robust optimization; Scenario Planning; Trade off; Decision making; benchmarking; decision making; multiobjective programming; optimization; trade-off; uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110643976

Recently, the concept of travel-related reasons for residential choice has been introduced, which reflects the actual extent to which the travel-related characteristics of the built environment were considered during the relocation decision. In this paper, we hypothesize that travel-related location reasons are stronger predictors of the built environment choice than generic mode attitudes. This hypothesis is examined by estimating both a cross-sectional and a longitudinal Structural Equation Model using data gathered in the Netherlands. The results suggest that the travel-related location reasons are indeed stronger predictors for built environment location than travel mode attitudes and that the directions of causality between attitudes, travel-related location reasons, the built environment, and travel behaviour often run in both directions. Substantively, our findings indicate that public transport use is most strongly affected by the built environment (after controlling for both stated reasons and attitudes), while car and bicycle use are hardly affected. From a practical point of view, this suggests that transforming the built environment to be more friendly to public transport may increase the use of public transport, but that, at least in the Netherlands, such a strategy would not work well if the aim were to reduce car use or increase bicycle use. © 2021 The Author(s)",Attitudes; Mobility panel Netherlands; Residential self-selection; Structural equation modelling; Travel behaviour; Travel-related reasons,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110352723

Yet at the same time, especially the humanitarian context with its characteristic volatility poses unique challenges to any technology. Most prominent are the humanitarian principles that are fundamental to humanitarian operations. These ethical principles are set to protect the most vulnerable populations. Designing blockchain projects in the humanitarian context therefore requires a systematic framework that helps humanitarians make critical choices. While some design instructions can be found for commercial applications, the humanitarian context requires different design principles and guidelines. To address the lack of a design framework for humanitarian blockchain projects, in this paper, we design and validate guidelines for humanitarian blockchain-projects. We use data from two humanitarian blockchain pilots in Jordan and Kenya to design our framework. Thereafter, we benchmark its applicability and relevance against another pilot in Vanuatu.

As a result, related studies are limited. This paper explores potential supply chain design and planning strategies of green ammonia production in the next decade of China with a case study in Inner Mongolia. A hybrid optimization-based simulation approach is applied, considering traditional optimization approaches are insufficient to address uncertainties and dynamics in a long-term energy transition. Results show that the production cost of green ammonia will be at least twice that of the current level due to higher costs of hydrogen supply. Production accounts for the largest share of the total expense of green hydrogen (~80 %). The decline of electricity and electrolyser prices are key in driving down the overall costs. In addition, by-product oxygen is also considered in the model to assess its economic benefits. We found that by-product oxygen sales could partly reduce the total expense of green hydrogen (~12 % at a price of USD 85/t), but it also should be noted that the volatile price of oxygen may pose uncertainties and risks to the effectiveness of the offset. Since the case study may represent the favourable conditions in China due to the abundant renewable energy resources and large-scale ammonia industry in this region, we propose to take a moderate step towards green ammonia production, and policies should be focused on reducing the electricity price and capital investments in green hydrogen production. We assume the findings and implications are informative to planning future green ammonia production in China. © 2021 The Author(s)",By-product oxygen; Energy transition; Green ammonia; Green hydrogen; Hydrogen supply chain; Optimization-based simulation,Ammonia; Costs; Hydrogen production; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Supply chains; Ammonia production; By-product oxygen; Case-studies; Energy transitions; Green ammonia; Green hydrogen; Hydrogen supply chains; Optimization-based simulations; Simulation approach; Supply-chain designs; Oxygen,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112580331

When focusing specifically on autonomous systems, a critical gap emerges: although there is much work on governance and attribution of accountability, there is a significant lack of methods for the operationalisation of accountability within the socio-technical layer of autonomous systems. In the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles-or drones— the critical question of how to maintain accountability as they undertake fully autonomous flights becomes increasingly important as their uses multiply in both the commercial and military fields. In this paper, we aim to fill the operationalisation gap by proposing a socio-technical framework to guarantee human oversight and accountability in drone deployments, showing its enforceability in the real case of military surveillance drones. By keeping a focus on accountability and human oversight as values, we align with the emphasis placed on human responsibility, while requiring a concretisation of what these principles mean for each specific application, connecting them with concrete socio-technical requirements. In addition, by constraining the framework to observable elements of pre-and post-deployment, we do not rely on assumptions made on the internal workings of the drone nor the technical fluency of the operator. © 2021 by the authors.

This is also the case for individuals, being systems themselves and, as such, being elements of those socio-technical systems. Individual behaviours result from individual perceptions (mental models). These individual behaviours ideally generate the desired outcomes of a system (team/organisation/society) and create value. However, at the same time, mental models and the associated individual behaviour also bring about unwanted consequences, destroying or diminishing value. Therefore, to achieve safety and to attain sustainable safe performance, understanding and managing mental models in organisations is of paramount importance. Consequently, in organisations and society, one needs to generate the required mental models that create successes and, at the same time, to avoid or eliminate damaging perceptions and ideas in order to protect the created value. Generating and managing mental models involves leadership; leadership skills; and the ability to develop a shared vision, mission and ambition, as this helps determine what is valuable and allows for aligning individual mental models with those that preferably govern the system. In doing so, it is possible to create well-aligned corporate cultures that create and protect value and that generate sustainable safe performance. To achieve this aim, a systemic organisational culture alignment model is proposed. The model is based on the model of logical levels of awareness according to Dilts (1990), Argyris’s ladder of inference (1982) and the organisational alignment model proposed by Tosti (1996). Furthermore, ISO 31000 (2009, 2018) and its guidance are proposed as a practical tool to accomplish this alignment and sustainable safe performance in organisations. Altogether, these elements define Total Respect Management as a concept, mental model and methodology. © 2021 by the authors.

It is proposed that costs should be allocated in a socially acceptable manner since there is no regulation in ICESs. In this paper, social acceptance is conceptualized from the dimension of community acceptance considering procedural and distributive justice. A fair process increases the understanding and the acceptance of the cost allocation outcomes, and a fair outcome leads to the acceptance of the cost allocation procedure. This approach adopted the multi-criteria decision-making technique to evaluate social acceptance to select a cost allocation method that was socially acceptable to local community members. The results show that our approach is unique and useful when multiple decision-making groups have to decide together upon the cost allocation method. It is able to provide quantitative results and optimal decisions from a multi-group decision-making perspective. The methodology developed in this research can be applied to any local community energy system to select a cost allocation method. Furthermore, the obtained results can be used by decision-makers to support them in the decision-making process.

The bowtie metaphor is used to visually present the BP Texas City refinery incident, showing the barrier system from different perspectives. Not only is the barrier system looked at from its trustworthiness on the day of the incident but also from the perspective of the control room operator, and from a design to current standards of best practice. The risk reductions of these different views are calculated and compared to their original design. In addition, evidence and findings from the investigations have been categorized as flaws and allocated to nine organizational factors. These flaws may affect the barrier system's quality or trustworthiness, or may act as ‘accident pathogens’ (see also Reason, 1990) creating latent, dangerous conditions.

Although homeowners are responsible for replacing their heating systems and improving dwelling insulation, they are not always able to make individual decisions. Some projects require group decisions within and between buildings. We use an agent-based modelling and simulation approach to explore how these individual and group decisions would influence natural gas consumption and heating costs in an illustrative neighbourhood, under a set of assumptions. We model individual household preferences over combinations of insulation and heating systems as a lifetime cost calculation with implicit discount rates, and we use quorum constraints to represent group decisions. We model three fiscal policies and a policy to disconnect all dwellings from the natural gas network. Results show that the disconnection policy was the only necessary and sufficient condition to incentivize households to replace their heating systems and that group decisions influenced the alternatives that were chosen. Since results were influenced by group decisions within buildings and by the market discount rate, we recommend further research regarding policies around these topics.

Active travel (walking and cycling) has been promoted as an effective means to stimulate physical activity. However, many of the available studies on the relation between active travel and health are based on cross-sectional data and are therefore unable to determine the direction of causation. This study aims to unravel the bidirectional relationships between active travel measured by the active modes bicycle, e-bike and walking, on the one hand, and two health outcomes, namely body-mass index (BMI) and self-rated health (SRH), on the other. Methods: To provide an initial assessment of the relationship between active travel and the two health outcomes, multivariate regression models are estimated. To study the direction of causation, Random-Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Models (RI-CLPM) are estimated using three waves of the Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN). Active travel is measured as travelled distances and trips with the bicycle, e-bike and walking. BMI is calculated based on weight and height, SRH is measured with a single question. Results: The regression models show that a higher BMI and lower SRH are associated with less walking and cycling, while being obese is associated with more e-bike use. The results of the RI-CLPM indicate that cycling distance has a positive effect on SRH. Furthermore, walking distance has a negative effect on BMI and BMI has a negative effect on bicycle use among people without obesity. No relationships between BMI and active travel are found for people with obesity. Conclusion: The results highlight the importance of longitudinal analyses when estimating the relationship between active travel and health. In addition, the results suggest that, relatively speaking, the increasing overweight and obesity rates may result in a decrease of bicycle use. © 2021",Active travel; Body-mass index (BMI); Panel data; Random intercept cross-lagged panel model (RI-CLPM); Self-rated health (SRH),,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107932722

Hence, this study aims to compare the metrics and methodologies used to measure, benchmark, and rank governments' progress in open government data initiatives. Using a critical meta-analysis approach, we compare nine benchmarks with reference to meta-data, meta-methods, and meta-theories. This study finds that both existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models use a great variety of metrics and methodologies, although open data impact is not usually measured. While several benchmarks’ methods have changed over time, and variables measured have been adjusted, we did not identify a similar pattern for academic open data progress models. This study contributes to open data research in three ways: 1) it reveals the strengths and weaknesses of existing open government data benchmarks and academic open data progress models; 2) it reveals that the selected open data benchmarks employ relatively similar measures as the theoretical open data progress models; and 3) it provides an updated overview of the different approaches used to measure open government data initiatives’ progress. Finally, this study offers two practical contributions: 1) it provides the basis for combining the strengths of benchmarks to create more comprehensive approaches for measuring governments’ progress in open data initiatives; and 2) it explains why particular countries are ranked in a certain way. This information is essential for governments and researchers to identify and propose effective measures to improve their open data initiatives. © 2021 The Authors",Benchmark; Maturity; Open government data; Performance; Progress; Rank,Government data processing; Public policy; Data impact; Effective measures; Meta analysis; Meta methods; Policy makers; Ranking lists; Similar measures; Similar pattern; Open Data,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107636463

Based on the goals and characteristics of different city branding strategies, this study identifies a growing level of sophistication from city promotion via city marketing to city branding and proposes that the degree of urban development of cities is positively related to the use of branding strategies. This proposition is tested among 23 Chinese cities: 21 cities in Guangdong province and two in the Special Administrative Regions – Hong Kong and Macao. The results show a positive correlation between the use of city promotion, city marketing and city branding strategies and a city's level of urban development. Only the largest and wealthiest cities, and those with the strongest tertiary sector report on the use of policies which indicate city branding. The strength of the primary sector is significantly and negatively related to all three identified forms of branding strategy. Furthermore, significant positive statistical inter-relationships exist between the different branding strategies, which confirm the existence of complex relations and overlaps between them. Our findings suggest that local governments should align their city branding strategies with their development goals. © 2021 The Author(s)",China; City branding; City marketing; City promotion; Progression proposition; Urban governance,governance approach; marketing; policy approach; strategic approach; urban development; urban economy; urban policy; urban politics; China; Guangdong; Hong Kong; Macau,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107123541

Business Model Innovation (BMI) leads to irreversible fundamental changes in key components of a company's business model, which means it carries with it a high level of risk, ambiguity and uncertainty. Drawing on the data from a cross-industry sample of 563 European SMEs, we apply structural equation modelling to examine how a firm's performance is affected by innovating its business model. A conceptual model is developed to examine how organisational capabilities and implementation of a profit- or growth-oriented strategy, as materialised in BMI, affect a firm's overall performance. The results indicate that, while the direct link between BMI and firm performance is not significant, this path is fully mediated through efficiency growth, organisational capabilities and revenue growth. Furthermore, there are significant direct effects from efficiency growth, organisational capabilities and revenue growth on firm performance. These findings confirm the validity of the model and contribute to existing literature on BMI efforts in SMEs and provide guidelines to help company owners/managers implement informed decisions about the implementation of BMI based on their firm's strategies. © 2021 The Author(s)",Business model innovation; Firm performance; Firm strategy; Organisational capabilities; SME,Competition; Business model innovation; Business modeling; Competitive advantage; Fundamental changes; Informed decision; Organisational capabilities; Small and medium-sized enterprise; Structural equation modelling; Efficiency,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105972709

This situation thus highlights the significance of balancing the economy with safety and health. Safety economics, considering the interdependencies between safety and micro-economics, is ideal for supporting this kind of decision-making. Although economic approaches such as cost-benefit analysis and cost-effectiveness analysis have been used in safety management, little attention has been paid to the fundamental issues and the primary methodologies in safety economics. Therefore, this paper presents a systematic study on safety economics to analyze the foundational issues and explore the possible approaches. Firstly, safety economics is defined as a transdisciplinary and interdisciplinary field of academic research focusing on the interdependencies and coevolution of micro-economies and safety. Then we explore the role of safety economics in safety management and production investment. Furthermore, to make decisions more profitable, economic approaches are summarized and analyzed for decision-making about prevention investments and/or safety strategies. Finally, we discuss some open issues in safety economics and possible pathways to improve this research field, such as security economics, risk perception, and multi-criteria analysis. © 2021",Approaches; Decision-making; Foundational issues; Safety economics; Safety management,Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Investments; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Safety engineering; 'current; Approach; Decisions makings; Economic approach; Foundational issue; Futures researches; Operational safety; Safety economic; Safety management; Trade off; Cost benefit analysis; article; attention; coevolution; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; drug safety; economics; investment; risk perception; security,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105549983

High temperature fuel cells such as molten carbonate fuel cells and solid oxide fuel cells produce significant amounts of heat that can be used for internal reforming of fuels such as natural gas to produce gas mixtures which are rich in hydrogen, while also producing electricity. This opens up the possibility of using high temperature fuel cells in systems designed for flexible coproduction of hydrogen and power at very high system efficiency. In a previous study, the flowsheet software Cycle-Tempo has been used to determine the technical feasibility of a solid oxide fuel cell system for flexible coproduction of hydrogen and power by running the system at different fuel utilization factors (between 60 and 95%). Lower utilization factors correspond to higher hydrogen production while at a higher fuel utilization, standard fuel cell operation is achieved. This study uses the same basis to investigate how a system with molten carbonate fuel cells performs in identical conditions also using Cycle-Tempo.

Corporate transgressions, as this behaviour is called, occur because of the actions of those in charge, usually bright and dedicated people. Immoral and unethical conduct can adversely affect the safety of workers, the general public and the environment. A scoping review method for a literature search is used to explore morality and ethics in relation to health and safety management. Our findings show that controlling the risks associated with misconduct and corporate transgression is not usually seen as a responsibility allocated to safety systems but is left to general management and corporate governance. The moral and ethical principles, however, can be applied in safety management systems to prevent misconduct and transgression-related safety risks. Our results show that ethical leadership, ethical behaviour, sustaining an ethical climate and implementation of an ethical decision-making process emerge as key preventive measures. The discussion presents a proposed way to include these measures in safety management systems. Conclusion and recommendations underline that unwanted behaviour and transgression risks can be brought under control, starting from a set of best practices. Not only the managers themselves but also board members, independent external supervisors and government regulators need to embrace these practices. © 2021 by the authors.

This calls for more sustainable utilization of resources based on past experiences and insights from many different disciplines. Interdisciplinary approaches to studies of historical commons have potential to identify drivers of change and keys to success in the past, and offer advice about the management and use of shared resources in contemporary and future systems. We address these issues by applying an ecological perspective to historical data on social-ecological systems. We perform comparisons and time series analyses for nine successful Dutch commons for which highresolution data on the regulatory activities and use of shared resources is available for on average 380 years (range 236 to 568) during the period 1300 to 1972. Within commons, institutional developments were oscillating, with periods of intense regulatory activity being separated by periods of low activity, and with the dynamics of regulations being largely independent across commons. Ecological theory posits that species that occupy similar niches should show correlated responses to environmental challenges; however, commons using more similar resources did not have more parallel or similar institutional developments. One notable exception was that sanctioning was more frequent in commons that directed more regulatory activities towards non-renewable subsoil resources, whereas there was no association between sanctioning and the use of renewable resources. This might indicate that commoners were aware of potential resource depletion and attempted to influence freeriding by actively trying to solve the underlying social dilemmas. Sanctioning regulations were more frequent during the first than during the second part of a common's life, indicating that while sanctioning might have been important for the establishment of commons it was not key to the long-term persistence of historical commons.

However, the optimization problem is difficult to solve since it is both nonsmooth and nonseparable. The existing numerical solutions implicate the use of several auxiliary variables in order to deal with the nondifferentiable penalty. Thus, the resulting algorithms are both time- and memory-inefficient. This paper proposes a compact neural network to solve the FLSA. The neural network has a one-layer structure with the number of neurons proportionate to the dimension of the given signal, thanks to the utilization of consecutive projections. The proposed neural network is stable in the Lyapunov sense and is guaranteed to converge globally to the optimal solution of the FLSA. Experiments on several applications from signal processing and biomedical engineering confirm the reasonable performance of the proposed neural network. © 2013 IEEE.",Fused lasso; global convergence; Lyapunov; neural network,Biomedical engineering; Biomedical signal processing; Optimization; Approximators; Auxiliary variables; Lyapunov sense; Non-differentiable; Numerical solution; One-layer structures; Optimal solutions; Optimization problems; Neural networks; article; biomedical engineering; memory; nerve cell; signal processing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112680676

One major view is that, while resilience originally was a descriptive concept denoting some adaptive property of ecosystems, subsequent applications to social contexts distorted its meaning and purpose by framing it as a transformative and normative quality. This article advances an alternative philosophical account based on the scrutiny of C.S. Holling’s original work on resilience. We show that resilience had a central role among Holling’s proposals for re-forming environmental science and management, and that Holling framed resilience as an ecosys-tem’s capacity of absorbing change and exploiting it for adapting or evolving, but also as the social ability of maintaining and opportunistically exploiting that natural capacity. Resilience therefore appears as a transformative social-ecological property that is normative in three ways: as an intrinsic ecological value, as a virtue of organizations or management styles, and as a virtuous understanding of human–nature relations. This interpretation accounts for the practical relevance of resilience, clar-ifies the relations between resilience and related terms, and is a firm ground for further normative work on resilience. © 2021 by the authors.

This implies a need to reconsider the currently used information systems (ISs), and to gain understanding of future requirements to satisfy their needs. We exploit a design science research (DSR) approach to shape these requirements. Among the many components of future ISs, we study ports’ track-and-trace (T&T) capability. The proposed information architecture (IA) enables to integrate T&T capability in PI ports by means of information carried on PI containers into the logistics chain via an open interface platform, which also supports interoperability among the various actors’ ISs. The design is based on the Reference Architecture Model for Industry 4.0 (RAMI 4.0). This model supports the analysis of PI ports in key dimensions along with hierarchical logistics entities, which could be used as a blueprint for IAs of PI ports, globally. We provide insights into the approach's applicability by means of the illustrative case of Teesport, located in Northeast England (United Kingdom). © 2021 The Authors",Industry 4.0; Information architecture; Interoperability; Logistics; Physical Internet; Track-and-trace,Architecture; Freight transportation; Information management; Information retrieval; Ships; Urban transportation; Design science researches (DSR); Freight transport; Information architectures; Interconnected network; Logistics chains; Logistics system; Reference architecture; Track and Trace; Network architecture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103120112

In this paper, we will discuss the meaning of these novel responsibilities focusing on two philosophical problems of attributing such responsibilities to innovators. The first is the allocation of responsibilities to innovators. Innovation is a process that involves a multiplicity of agents and unpredictable, far-reaching causal chains from innovation to social impacts, which creates great uncertainty. A second problem is constituted by possible trade-offs between different kinds of responsibility. It is evident that attributing backward-looking responsibility for product failures diminishes the willingness to learn about such defects and to take forward-looking responsibility. We will argue that these problems can be overcome by elaborating what it is exactly that innovators are responsible for. In this manner, we will distinguish more clearly between holding responsible and taking responsibility. This opens a space for ‘supererogatory’ responsibilities. Second, we will argue that both innovation processes and outcomes can be objects of innovators’ responsibility. Third, we will analyze different kinds of responsibility (blameworthiness, accountability, liability, obligation and virtue) and show that the functions of their attribution are not necessarily contradictory. Based on this conceptual refinement, we will argue that accountability, responsibility-as-virtue and the willingness to take responsibility are crucial for responsible innovation. © 2018, The Author(s).",Accountability; Engineering; Ethics; Responsibility; Responsible innovation; Technology; Virtue,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054304121

This paper presents the use of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and Life Cycle Costing (LCC) in the development of technology solutions for the treatment of brine wastewater and recovery of by-products. Four industrial case studies are assessed that apply different innovative technology configurations, to treat the brines and recover the water, salts and mineral compounds. The assessment focusses on identifying hotspots and potential design improvements for the four case studies. In addition, the development of a unified approach for prospective LCA and LCC is illustrated to promote robustness and consistency in the analysis of the four systems. The analysis reveals that the impact and cost of treatment is highly dependent on the wastewater composition. Critically, whether the recovery of compounds and deionised water can counteract the impact and cost of the treatment systems. The early analysis suggests that this is possible for two of the cases studies. Estimates of the GHG emissions for the initial system analysis, range from 10 to 17 kg CO2e/m3, whilst costs range from €10/m3 to €25/m3. However, both are expected to decrease at full scale and are sensitive to costs of energy, chemicals and revenue from recovered by-products. The LCA's highlight chemical and energy consumption as critical hotspots. Design considerations therefore focus on the reduction of chemicals, reuse or switching to lower impact chemicals, and maximising by-product recovery, and using renewable energy. © 2021 The Authors",By-product recovery; Circular economy; Life cycle costing; Prospective life cycle assessment; Wastewater treatment,Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Deionized water; Economic analysis; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Indicators (chemical); Industrial water treatment; Life cycle; Recovery; By products recovery; Case-studies; Circular economy; Hot spot; Life cycle costing; Multiple-case study; Prospective life cycle assessment; Resource recovery; Technological development; Treatment design; Wastewater treatment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105494349

Marginal Abatement Cost (MAC) curves are constructed to provide an overview of the most cost-effective decarbonisation options. Both energy efficiency technologies and alternative heating systems are combined in order to achieve technological configurations for full decarbonisation of this industry. Energy consumption for vegetable oil processing can be reduced by 44% for rapeseed oil, 45% soybean oil, and 57% for palm oil. Vertical Ice Condensing is the most cost-effective decarbonisation option, while biogas boilers are the most cost-effective alternative heating systems that can supply energy in all stages of production. However, the availability of processing residues limits the energy substitution possible with biogas boilers. Electric boilers are therefore required to deliver the residual energy necessary to realise zero carbon emissions.

The effectiveness of charging is investigated through analysis of the states of charge (SoC) at departure of EVs plugged in at the parking lot over the simulated year. Although the share of vehicles leaving with inadequate charge over the entire year is small, this share is relatively high during low irradiance winter months. We show that an increase in efficiency of the solar modules used in the system and an increase in the minimum duration of time spent at the parking lot are effective within limits at improving charging adequacy. We then formulate three strategies to allocate the available energy in the system with the objective of reducing the number of vehicles leaving at lower SoCs: 1) curtailment of charging beyond 80% state of charge, 2) prioritised charging of vehicles at low SoCs and 3) prioritised charging based on both SoC and time before departure. We identify the strategy prioritising vehicles with low state of charge to be most effective, but performance in the worst month remains a challenge for the location considered. © 2021 The Author(s)",Charging; Electric vehicle; Off-grid; Solar,Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric power transmission networks; Photovoltaic cells; Solar concentrators; Solar power generation; Vehicle-to-grid; Charging; Off-grid solar; Off-grids; Parking locations; Parking lots; Solar; Solar charging; Solar photovoltaic system; States of charges; Work analysis; Electric vehicles; electric vehicle; parking; photovoltaic system; solar power,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103761708

Coproduction theory is built upon Western experience and currently focuses on the types of coproduction in different policy stages, the barriers and governance strategies for co-production. However, little attention is paid to how political background will influence the co-production process. To fill the gap, we analyzed a case of co-production that occurred in China, and we characterized the political background as consisting of three main political features: political mobility, central–local relations, and performance measurement. Based on an in-depth case study of a government project in a medium-sized Chinese city, the impact and the changes of political features affecting governmental projects in different co-production stages are analyzed and assessed. We find that political features play a critical role in the co-production of China’s large government projects and may separately and jointly affect co-production. Government performance measurement affects the co-design and co-implementation of projects. Political mobility and changes in local government and performance measurement also affect the co-implementation continuity of the project. Political focus affects the co-design of projects. Central-local relations influence the support from higher government and the actual practices of lower government in the co-implementation stage. © 2021 by the authors.

The upgrade of new generation mobile communication technologies is attracting more and more attention to conduct a shore-based broadband mobile communication network with high-latency and high reliability to serve the maritime industries. This paper presents a solution by means of building a ship-to-infrastructure (S2I) and a ship-to-ship (S2S) wireless communication networks for an offshore region. We characterize the S2I and S2S channels at 5.9 GHz band based on the channel measurements in realistic environments. The channel characteristics, including power delay profile, delay spread, propagation path loss, are extracted and analyzed. In view of the difference between marine and terrestrial communications, we analyze the influencing factors of the offshore water, including effective reflection, divergence and shadowing from the water surface, and diffraction loss caused by the earth curvature. We also predict the power coverage range and the channel capacity for S2I and S2S wireless communications. Finally, the communication performance is evaluated according to the channel measurement and characterization analysis.

The global path is obtained via an improved artificial potential field (APF) method, which makes up for the shortcoming that the typical APF method easily falls into a local minimum. A modified velocity obstacle (VO) method that incorpo-rates the closest point of approach (CPA) model and the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea (COLREGS), based on the typical VO method, can be used to get the local path. The contribution of this research is two-fold: (1) improvement of the typical APF and VO methods, making up for previous shortcomings, and integrated COLREGS rules and good seamanship, making the paths obtained more in line with navigation practice; (2) the research included global and local path planning, considering both the safety and maneuverability of the ship in the process of avoiding collision, and studied the whole process of avoiding collision in a relatively entirely way. A case study was then conducted to test the proposed approach in different situations. The results indicate that the proposed approach can find both global and local paths to avoid the target ship. © 2021 by the authors.

Making use of theories and concepts from economics, psychology, sociology, and geography, this work argues that lasting effects can be expected, and specifically that peak demand among car and public transport users may be lower than if the pandemic would never have happened. The magnitude of such effects at the aggregate level in terms of the total travel time of all inhabitants of a country or state is likely limited. Such lasting effects imply that additional infrastructure extensions to reduce congestion on roads and crowding in public transport might have a lower benefit-cost ratio than would be the case without these impacts.

Policymakers aspire to alleviate this problem by implementing publicly funded projects. This study has three aims: 1) to explore citizen preferences regarding the public funding of projects promoting a healthy body weight among people with a low income, 2) to identify whether such preferences differ between citizens with a low income and those with a higher income, and 3) to identify the reasons underlying these preferences. We conducted a Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE) among 1053 Dutch citizens to achieve these aims. In an online choice experiment, respondents were asked to advise on the implementation of eight different projects that encourage a healthy body weight among citizens with a low income, with a total resource constraint of 100,000 euros. The projects were 1) lifestyle coaching including sports, 2) lifestyle coaching without sports, 3) local sports coach, 4) fruit and vegetable boxes, 5) bariatric surgery, 6) improving the living environment, 7) courses on healthy lifestyles, and 8) sports vouchers. We used the “Multiple Discrete-Continuous Extreme Value” model to estimate the preferences of respondents towards these eight projects. Fruit and vegetable boxes and sports vouchers were the most popular projects, while bariatric surgery was least popular. Respondents with a low income tended to spend less of the budget than respondents with a higher income.

They often mentioned the value judgements ‘importance’, ‘healthiness’ and ‘usefulness’, as well as project costs and efficacy, as reasons for their decisions.

When evaluating policies using such models, the costs and benefits are typically aggregated across all actors in the system, and over the entire planning horizon. While a policy may be beneficial when considering the aggregate outcome, it can be harmful to some people, somewhere, at some point in time. The practice of aggregating over all actors and over time thus gives rise to problems of justice; it could also exacerbate existing injustices. While the literature discusses some of these injustices in ad-hoc and case specific manner, a systematic approach for considering distributive justice in model-based climate change planning is lacking. This study aims to fill this gap by proposing 11 requirements that an Integrated Assessment Model should meet in order to enable the assessment of distributive justice in climate mitigation and adaptation policies. We derive the requirements from various ethical imperatives stemming from the theory of distributive justice. More specifically, we consider both intra-generational (among people within one generation) and intergenerational (between generations) distributive justice. We investigate to what extent the 11 requirements are being met in recent model-based climate planning studies, and highlight several directions for future research to advance the accounting for distributive justice in model-based support for climate change planning.

Findings indicate that imagined publics often build upon deficit assumptions; people are (unjustly) considered unknowledgeable, incapable, unwilling and irresponsible agents in governance. While insightful, deficit-based explanations insufficiently capture the broad diversity of publics imagined around energy system change. In this paper, we share the results of a Q-study, designed to systematically identify diverse imagined publics in the Dutch heat transition. We found five imaginaries: 1. “Meaningful participation in a diverse society” 2. “Strong and enthusiastic communities in the lead” 3. “NIMBYs, social contestation and the threat to decarbonisation” 4. “Collectivism & vulnerable groups at risk” 5. “Unburdening individual user-consumers in the transition”. Each imaginary builds upon a different set of epistemic, action and normative assumptions, which construct public agency and responsibility in transitions in distinctive ways. We explore how these constructions come to justify roles and obligations for publics as well of other actors in the heat transition. One of our main contributions is that we explicitly move beyond the analysis of singular imaginaries as we consider imaginaries to be interactive, holistic, and contextual. In comparison, key social, ethical, and political tensions and trade-offs in the heat transition become visible. © 2021 The Authors",Agency; Citizen inclusion; Heat transition; Imagined publics; Q methodology; Responsibility,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105702845

This paper answers the question whether indicators can be derived from the barrier system status to provide information about the development and likelihood of the major accident processes in the ammonia production process. The accident processes are visualized as scenarios in bowties. This research focuses on the status of the preventive barriers on the left-hand side of the bowtie. Both the quality – expressed in reliability/availability and effectiveness – and the activation of the barrier system give an indication of the development of the accident scenarios and the likelihood of the central event. This likelihood is calculated as a loss of risk reduction compared to the original design. The calculation results in an indicator called “preventive barrier indicator”, which should initiate further action. Based on an example, it is demonstrated which actions should be taken and what their urgency is. © 2021 The Authors",Ammonia; Barrier; Bowtie; Indicator; Process safety; Scenario,Accident prevention; Accidents; Indicators (instruments); Ammonia production; Barrier; Barrier systems; Bow tie; Industry based; Major accidents; Process industries; Process safety; Production process; Scenario; Ammonia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105263364

The building sector represents a key area for curbing the consumption trend and reducing energy-related emissions by adopting energy efficiency strategies. Building age acts as a proxy for building insulation properties and is an important parameter for energy models that facilitate decision making. The present study explores the potential of predicting residential building age at a large geographical scale from open spatial data sources in eight municipalities in the German federal state of North-Rhine Westphalia. The proposed framework combines building attributes with street and block metrics as classification features in a Random Forest model. Results show that the addition of urban fabric metrics improves the accuracy of building age prediction in specific training scenarios. Furthermore, the findings highlight the way in which the spatial disposition of training and test samples influences classification accuracy. Additionally, the paper investigates the impact of age misclassification on residential building heat demand estimation. The age classification model leads to reasonable errors in energy estimates, in various scenarios of training, which suggests that the proposed method is a promising addition to the urban energy modelling toolkit. © 2021 The Authors",Open data; Random forest; Residential building age; Residential heat demand; Spatial autocorrelation; Urban morphology,Decision making; Decision trees; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Housing; Building insulations; Classification accuracy; Classification features; Energy-efficiency strategies; Energy-related emissions; Random forest modeling; Residential building; Urban energy consumption; Energy efficiency; age structure; consumption behavior; energy planning; energy use; error analysis; heat balance; modeling; prediction; residential energy; spatial analysis; urban morphology; urbanization; Germany; North Rhine-Westphalia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104689453

Cost allocation within an ICES is one of the key issues determining the success of ICESs. The costs should be allocated fairly among the members of a local energy community. However, not much research has been directed towards cost allocation in local energy systems. In this paper, firstly, we compare ICESs with large power systems in terms of their physical and cost structure. Secondly, learning from experience with electricity tariff design, we derive cost allocation approaches for ICESs. To this end, we summarize tariff design objectives, cost allocation procedures and the underlying regulatory principles for major tariffication approaches and discuss how these concepts may be applied to cost allocation in ICESs. Discussions on the lessons learned so far and application issues in ICESs are included in this paper. This review paper paves the way for application of fair cost allocation in ICESs by providing a systemic framework. © 2021 The Authors",Cost allocation; Distributed energy resources; Integrated community energy systems; Local communities; Local energy systems; Tariff design,Cost accounting; Community energy; Cost-allocation; Distributed Energy Resources; Energy systems; Energy transitions; Integrated community energy system; Key Issues; Local community; Local energy systems; Tariff designs; Energy resources,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103666726

Despite its potential, existing crowdsourcing platforms encounter several challenges, including (1) fragmentation of expertise, as there are many platforms, (2) distrust between task providers and crowdsourcing participants, as identity and past performance are often not known, and (3) inability to learn from experience due to a lack of openness. A reference architecture for blockchain-based knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing platforms to mediate transactions between demand and supply of knowledge is designed in this paper to overcome these challenges. A design science research method is followed to develop the architecture. The reference architecture shows how blockchain and smart contract components can be integrated to support and coordinate knowledge-intensive crowdsourcing activities. By removing traditional e-commerce intermediaries, blockchain reduces search friction, knowledge transfer costs, and cheating by task providers or crowdsourcing participants. © 2021 by the authors.

First, an assessment based on 26 articles on this topic reveals much exploratory, conceptual, qualitative, and practice-driven research in studies reflecting the increasing complexities of using AI in government – and the resulting implications, opportunities, and risks thereof for public governance. Second, based on both the literature review and the analysis of articles included in this special issue, we propose a research agenda comprising eight process-related recommendations and seven content-related recommendations. Process-wise, future research on the implications of the use of AI for public governance should move towards more public sector-focused, empirical, multidisciplinary, and explanatory research while focusing more on specific forms of AI rather than AI in general. Content-wise, our research agenda calls for the development of solid, multidisciplinary, theoretical foundations for the use of AI for public governance, as well as investigations of effective implementation, engagement, and communication plans for government strategies on AI use in the public sector. Finally, the research agenda calls for research into managing the risks of AI use in the public sector, governance modes possible for AI use in the public sector, performance and impact measurement of AI use in government, and impact evaluation of scaling-up AI usage in the public sector. © 2021 The Author(s)",Artificial intelligence; Artificial intelligence for government; Digital government; Public governance; Public sector; Research agenda; Systematic literature review,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103086959

Individuals with high optimism bias and high levels of anxiety were less satisfied with the governments' response, albeit for different reasons. Individuals who reported low perceived severity and low government satisfaction engaged the least in behavioral changes, whereas participants who reported high perceived severity and low government satisfaction engaged the most in behavioral changes.

In practice, ISNs regularly fail when partners leave and the recovery of residual streams ends. Regarding the current societal need for a shift towards sustainability, it is undesirable that ISNs should fail. Failures of ISNs may be caused by actor behaviour that leads to unanticipated economic losses. In this paper, we explore the effect of these behaviours on ISN robustness by using an agent-based model (ABM). The constructed model is based on insights from both literature and participatory modelling in three real-world cases. It simulates the implementation of synergies for local waste exchange and compost production. The Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was used to model agent behaviour in time-dependent bilateral negotiations and synergy evaluation processes. We explored model behaviour with and without TPB logic across a range of possible TPB input variables. The simulation results show how the modelled planned behaviour affects the cash flow outcomes of the social agents and the robustness of the network. The study contributes to the theoretical development of industrial symbiosis research by providing a quanti-tative model of all ISN implementation stages, in which various behavioural patterns of entrepreneurs are in-cluded. It also contributes to practice by offering insights on how network dynamics and robustness outcomes are not only related to context and ISN design, but also to actor behaviour. © 2021, University of Surrey.

We test the effects of Ostrom’s well-known Design Principles for collective action and use an extensive database collected in 123 cases in Germany and two case studies in the Netherlands to validate it. The model uses the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework and integrates decision mechanisms derived from the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). This allows the analysis of volunteer participation in urban community gardens over time, based on the garden’s institutions (Design Principles) and the volunteer’s intention to join gardening.

Relying on weather-dependent power generation, however, poses substantial risks if climate variability is not adequately understood and accounted for in energy system design. Here we quantify European wind and solar generation variability over the last century, finding that both vary on a multidecadal scale, but wind more strongly. We identify hotspots and study dominant patterns of (co-)variability, finding that solar generation varies mostly uniformly across Europe while the leading wind variability modes reveal cross-border balancing potential. Combined wind and solar power generation in the current European system exhibits multidecadal variability of around 5% and can be further reduced through European cooperation or locally optimized wind shares, albeit the latter comes at the expense of significantly enhancing seasonal to interannual variability. Improved spatial planning therefore offers multiple options to mitigate long-term renewable generation variability but requires careful assessments of the trade-offs between climate-induced variations on different timescales. © 2021 The Author(s).

However, perceived accessibility, defined as the perceived potential to participate in spatially dispersed opportunities, is often poorly reflected by these calculated measures. This paper sets out to explain the mechanisms that lead to these mismatches. A conceptual model is constructed to establish what factors shape perceived accessibility. A schematic framework shows that mismatches between a calculated indicator and perceptions can stem from inaccuracies in awareness as well as from inaccuracies in the measure if the measure fails to take account of the subjective evaluations of accessibility components. When evaluating the performance of land-use and transport system configurations, calculated measures based on spatial and transport data only serve as proxies for how accessibility is actually experienced. This paper argues that bringing perceived accessibility to the fore of accessibility-based planning, by acknowledging and evaluating potential mismatches with calculated accessibility indicators, will advance the evolution from mobility-based to accessibility-based planning. © 2021",Accessibility; Conceptual model; Perceived accessibility; Policy evaluation; Transport planning,accessibility; conceptual framework; spatial data; transportation planning; Indicator indicator,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107119659

Although the need to update scenarios for decision-making is recognized, a structured way for executing this process remains unclear. To configure a solution, we propose two concepts that need to be introduced: 1) that scenarios consist of a multi-layered structure, and 2) that changes should be classified according to their impact and uncertainty. Based on this classification, changes are incorporated into the different distinguished layers. To apply these concepts during an update, the paper presents a framework to structurally incorporate new information and uncertainties into scenarios, keeping them up-to-date while guaranteeing that the scenarios remain realistic and useful. The framework is applied to a test case consisting of three scenarios describing the European power market to illustrate how the framework performs in a practical context. Electric Vehicles are chosen as an uncertainty to illustrate how to structurally incorporate changes. Results show that using the framework allows the complexity of the update to be simplified into a step-by-step process. Additionally, it increases transparency by creating a common language for understanding if and how the changing external environment should be incorporated within scenarios. © 2021 The Author(s)",Electric vehicles; Electricity market; Framework; Scenarios; Uncertainty; Updating,electric vehicle; energy market; scenario analysis; uncertainty analysis; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105315533

Often, these sessions are supported by a facilitator, who organizes the session, sets learning goals, and guides the players through briefing, game play and debriefing (Taylor, Backlund & Niklasson, 2012), which we call facilitation. Debriefing is a vital part of the facilitation process, as according to Crookall (2010) and Kriz (2010), it facilitates learning. Contrary to many traditional models that locate the debriefing phase at the very end of a simulation gaming session, we conceptualize debriefing as reflection moments during the whole session, in which participants have the opportunity to reflect on their game play, experiences, and learnings. Facilitation is the process of enabling participants to address challenging situations of the game play, and make connections between the game play and the real environment the game refers to throughout the simulation gaming session. Method & Results.: We analysed existing debriefing literature within the Simulation & Gaming journal. This review revealed that many existing approaches do not sufficiently consider changing needs of participants during a simulation gaming session to allow for a direct reflection on what is happening. Instead, a large number of debriefing approaches focus on a post-action reflection only. Moreover, the approaches analysed in our article often are abstract and only provide scarce practical recommendations. In addition to the literature review, we draw conclusions from observations of our own work in and with simulation gaming sessions. Based on the related and our own work, we propose a new model for simulation game facilitation, which better connects moments of reflection with the game play - the Impulse-Debriefing-Spiral. Conclusions.: We provide a holistic understanding of debriefing that helps facilitators when implementing simulation games for learning purposes. Our model, called the Impulse-Debriefing-Spiral, conceptualizes the role of facilitation between briefing and debriefing throughout the whole process of a simulation gaming session - starting with its planning to reacting on emerging needs of the participants in between, up to closing the session as last step before transferring new knowledge and competencies into a new context (learning transfer). © 2021 SAGE Publications.",debriefing; facilitation; facilitator; impulse; learning transfer; simulation games,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104528804

There is uncertainty about which charging deployment tactic to follow. The main issue is how many of charging stations, of which type, should be installed and where. Early roll-out has been successful in many places, but knowledge on how to plan a large-scale charging network in urban areas is missing. Little is known about return to scale effects, reciprocal effects of charger availability on sales, and the impact of fast charging or more clustered charging hubs on charging preferences of EV owners. This paper explores the effects of various roll-out strategies for charging infrastructure that facilitate the large-scale introduction of EVs, using agent-based simulation. In contrast to previously proposed models, our model is rooted in empirically observed charging patterns from EVs instead of travel patterns of fossil fuelled cars. In addition, the simulation incorporates different user types (inhabitants, visitors, taxis and shared vehicles) to model the diversity of charging behaviours in an urban environment. Different scenarios are explored along the lines of the type of charging infrastructure (level 2, clustered level 2, fast charging) and the intensity of rollout (EV to charging point ratio). The simulation predicts both the success rate of charging attempts and the additional discomfort when searching for a charging station. Results suggest that return to scale and reciprocal effects in charging infrastructure are considerable, resulting in a lower EV to charging station ratio on the longer term. © 2021 The Author(s)",Agent-based simulation; Business case; Charging behaviour; Infrastructure utilization; Policy,Agent based simulation; Business case; Charging behavior; Charging infrastructures; Charging station; Infrastructure utilization; Large-scales; Return to scale; Scale effects; Urban areas; Electric vehicles; electric vehicle; simulation; transportation infrastructure; urban area; urban growth,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104289399

More sustainable heating systems are required in city districts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. However, these systems may lack social acceptance as they often require significant adjustments to homes and may lead to a noticeable loss of in-home thermal comfort. Predicting social acceptance is often difficult due to the long-term planning horizon for energy systems. It is therefore unclear which design requirements and policy guidelines need to be specified ex ante. We suggest an approach to anticipate social acceptance by identifying value conflicts embedded in sustainable heating systems in specific social settings. These value conflicts might cause a lack of social acceptance over time due to value change. We demonstrate this approach using a case of community-driven heating initiative in The Hague, the Netherlands. We identify value conflicts embedded in various sustainable heating systems using an agent-based model. We formulate scenarios of value change to understand the severity of resulting social acceptance issues and discuss suitable heating systems for the city district. The approach can be used to support the decision-making process of policymakers at the local level, even in situations of limited local expertise. © 2021 The Author(s)",Agent-based modelling; Scenario discovery; Social acceptance; Sustainable heating; Value change; Value conflicts,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Embedded systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating equipment; Simulation platform; Social aspects; Agent-based modeling; Ex antes; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heating system; Model approach; Scenario discovery; Social acceptance; Sustainable heating; Value change; Value conflict; Heating; energy policy; environmental assessment; greenhouse gas; heating; policy making; sustainability; sustainable development; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103931502

The lemniscate principle links people, technologies and the sociocultural world in the joint production of meaning and explicates the feedback channels between the three counterparts. When people make sense of technologies, they necessarily engage their moral histories to comprehend new technologies and fit them in daily practices. As such, the lemniscate principle offers a chance to explore the moral dynamics taking place during technological appropriation. Using digital voice assistants as an example, I show how these AI-guided devices mediate our moral inclinations, decisions and even our values, while in parallel suggesting how to use and design them in an informed and critical way. © 2021, The Author(s).",AI; Hermeneutic lemniscate; Technological appropriation; Technological mediation; Value change; Voice assistants,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101350841

One option to contribute to this goal is Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion (OTEC). Despite a global theoretical potential of up to 30 TW, its economically deployable share remains unknown. This paper proposes a novel methodology, which enables to determine OTEC's economic potential for any regional scope considering technical, economic and natural variables. The methodology was tested for 100 MWe OTEC in Indonesia on a provincial and national level. Against a regionally variable electricity tariff of 6.67–18.14 US$ct.(2018)/kWh, the national economic potential is 0–2 GWe with a Levelized Cost of Electricity (LCOE) as low as 15.6 US$ct.(2018)/kWh. With an annual electricity production of 0–16 TWh, OTEC could provide up to 6% of Indonesia's electricity demand in 2018. The capacity factor, capital expenses and discount rate are the most sensitive variables of the LCOE on average. A nationally uniform feed-in tariff of 18 US$ct.(2018)/kWh or more could increase the economic potential significantly.

We want to show how an introduction of Machine Learning systems alters the diagnostic process. Reviewing the negative conception of bias and incorporating the mediating role of Machine Learning systems in the medical diagnosis are essential for an encompassing, critical and informed medical decision-making. Methods: This paper presents a philosophical analysis, employing the conceptual frameworks of hermeneutics and technological mediation, while drawing on the case of Machine Learning algorithms assisting doctors in diagnosis. This paper unravels the non-neutral role of algorithms in the doctor's decision-making and points to the dialogical nature of interaction not only with the patients but also with the technologies that co-shape the diagnosis. Findings: Following the hermeneutical model of medical diagnosis, we review the notion of bias to show how it is an inalienable and productive part of diagnosis. We show how Machine Learning biases join the human ones to actively shape the diagnostic process, simultaneously expanding and narrowing medical attention, highlighting certain aspects, while disclosing others, thus mediating medical perceptions and actions. Based on that, we demonstrate how doctors can take Machine Learning systems on board for an enhanced medical diagnosis, while being aware of their non-neutral role. Conclusions: We show that Machine Learning systems join doctors and patients in co-designing a triad of medical diagnosis. We highlight that it is imperative to examine the hermeneutic role of the Machine Learning systems. Additionally, we suggest including not only the patient, but also colleagues to ensure an encompassing diagnostic process, to respect its inherently hermeneutic nature and to work productively with the existing human and machine biases. © 2021 The Authors.

We first proposed a hierarchical architecture of cooperation in the waterborne transport systems. Three layers of cooperation are identified according to the range of communication and cooperation, i.e., the individual layer, the local layer, and the network layer. The individual layer is the basis layer where a controller controls the dynamics of an individual vessel. The local layer considers the vessel-to-vessel (V2V) and vessel-to-infrastructure (V2I) interactions. The network layer considers not only V2V and V2I interactions but also the interdependence of the interconnected infrastructures, i.e., infrastructure-to-infrastructure interactions.

However, limited information exists on the potential environmental impacts of these promising sustainable innovations when operating on a large-scale. To fill this gap, the performance of AE and PEM systems is compared, using ex-ante Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), technology analysis and exploratory scenarios for which a refined methodology has been developed to study the effects of implementing large-scale sustainable hydrogen production systems. Ex-ante LCA allows modelling the environmental impacts of hydrogen production, exploratory scenario analysis allows modelling possible upscaling effects at potential future states of hydrogen production and use in vehicles in the Netherlands in 2050. A bridging tool for mapping the technological field has been created enabling the combination of quantitative LCAs with qualitative scenarios. This tool also enables diversity for exploring multiple sets of visions. The main results from the paper show, with an exception for the “ozone depletion” impact category, (1) that large-scale AE and PEM systems have similar environmental impacts with variations lower than 7% in all impact categories, (2) that the contribution of the electrolyser is limited to 10% of all impact categories results, and (3) that the origin of the electricity is the largest contributor to the environmental impact contributing to more than 90% in all impact categories, even when renewable energy sources are used. It is concluded that the methodology was applied successfully and provides a solid basis for an ex-ante assessment framework that can be applied to emerging technological systems. © 2021",Electrolyser; Ex-ante LCA; Exploratory scenarios; Hydrogen; Low carbon; Morphological analysis; Technology analysis,Acidification; Artificial life; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Hydrogen production; Ozone layer; Polyelectrolytes; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Renewable energy resources; Solid electrolytes; Sustainable development; Alkaline electrolytes; Electrolysers; Ex antes; Ex-ante life cycle assessment; Exploratory scenario; Large-scales; Low carbon; Morphological analysis; Polymer electrolyte membranes; Technology analysis; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103548274

However, evaluations of adaptation often adopt an aggregated perspective, while disaggregation of results is important to learn about who benefits when and where. A typical example is adaptation of rice agriculture in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD). Efforts focused on flood protection have mainly benefitted large-scale farmers while harming small-scale farmers. To investigate the distributional consequences of adaptation policies in the VMD, we assess both aggregate total output and equity indicators, as well as disaggregated impacts in terms of district-level farming profitability. Doing so requires an adequate representation of the multisectoral dynamics between the human and biophysical systems which influence farming profitability. We develop a spatially explicit integrated assessment model that couples inundation, sedimentation, soil fertility and nutrient dynamics, and behavioral land-use change and farming profitability calculation. We find that inter-district inequality responds in a non-linear way to climatic and socio-economic changes and choices of adaptation policies. The patterns of who wins and who loses could change substantially when a different policy is implemented or if a slightly different uncertain future materializes. We also find that there is no simple ranking of alternative adaptation policies, so one should make trade-offs based on agreed preferences. Accounting for equity implies exploring the distribution of outcomes over different groups over a range of uncertain futures. Only by accounting for multisectoral dynamics can planners anticipate the equity consequences of adaptation and prepare additional measures to aid the worse-off actors. © 2021. The Authors.

The paper discusses the added value of these types of communities to help address uncertain futures from the impact of climate change, which are highly context dependent. The paper frames these communities of innovation as part of innovation ecosystems in order to reflect on their key elements and added value. We argue that climate change and disaster risk management responses need to meet the needs of those experiencing problems with those that can offer solutions in distinct localities, including those that could fund or finance potential innovative solutions. Developing communities of innovation with the specific task of anticipating and creating niche solutions has been gaining traction in the EU. Some developed under the H2020 BRIGAID project are analysed here for other emergent COIs, as future-oriented communities tasked with the challenge to reduce disaster risks and enhance the climate resilience in their own spaces. This paper reflects on the experience of participants in these communities and their reflections and experience on whether these offer a useful form of organisation to anticipate future challenges, create niche solutions, and bring innovations to the market. The paper concludes with how communities of innovation can contribute to niche design and narratives of change to help achieve social and environmental resilience to reframe and help transition and transform current systems into more resilient, future-oriented communities. © 2021 by the authors.

However, research on India, where the high and rising level of ambient air pollution is a significant health concern, is limited. In this study, we analyze the association between ambient PM2.5 and LBW in India. We match data on birth weight from the National Family and Health Survey (NFHS) conducted in India in 2015-16 with high-resolution spatial data on annual ambient PM2.5 concentration to calculate in-utero exposure based on the residential location of each child. We estimate the association of in-utero exposure to ambient PM2.5 with birth weight and LBW, after adjusting for child level, maternal, and household level characteristics that predict birth weight. In our sample (n = 149 416), in comparison to the reference category of in-utero PM2.5 level less than 26.7 µg m-3, the adjusted OR of LBW increases non-linearly from 1.098 (95% CI: 0.954, 1.263) for children in the exposure band 39.3-44.7 µg m-3 (i.e., the fourth octile) to 1.241 (95% CI: 1.065, 1.447) for those in the exposure band 44.7-51.6 µg m-3 (i.e., the fifth octile) and 1.405 (95% CI: 1.126,1.753) for those with in-utero PM2.5 level greater than 77.3 µg m-3 (i.e., the last octile).

Public participation in decisions regarding (the relaxation of) these measures has been notably absent, despite being recommended in the literature. Here, as one of the exceptions, we report the results of 30, 000 citizens advising the government on eight different possibilities for relaxing lockdown measures in the Netherlands. By making use of the novel method Participatory Value Evaluation (PVE), participants were asked to recommend which out of the eight options they prefer to be relaxed. Participants received information regarding the societal impacts of each relaxation option, such as the impact of the option on the healthcare system. The results of the PVE informed policymakers about people's preferences regarding (the impacts of) the relaxation options. For instance, we established that participants assign an equal value to a reduction of 100 deaths among citizens younger than 70 years and a reduction of 168 deaths among citizens older than 70 years. We show how these preferences can be used to rank options in terms of desirability. Citizens advised to relax lockdown measures, but not to the point at which the healthcare system becomes heavily overloaded. We found wide support for prioritising the re-opening of contact professions. Conversely, participants disfavoured options to relax restrictions for specific groups of citizens as they found it important that decisions lead to ""unity""and not to ""division"". 80% of the participants state that PVE is a good method to let citizens participate in government decision-making on relaxing lockdown measures. Participants felt that they could express a nuanced opinion, communicate arguments, and appreciated the opportunity to evaluate relaxation options in comparison to each other while being informed about the consequences of each option. This increased their awareness of the dilemmas the government faces. © 2021 Mouter et al.",,age distribution; Article; coronavirus disease 2019; decision making; disease burden; Dutchman; government decision making; government regulation; health care management; health care system; human; lockdown exit strategy; mortality; Netherlands; participatory value evaluation; public participation; public policy; relaxing lockdown measure; social behavior; social welfare; adult; aged; communicable disease control; community participation; epidemiology; female; government; male; management; middle aged; prevention and control; procedures; public opinion; questionnaire; young adult; Adult; Aged; Communicable Disease Control; Community Participation; COVID-19; Female; Government; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Netherlands; Policy Making; Public Opinion; Surveys and Questionnaires; Young Adult,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105359207

We follow a generative social science approach in which agent-based simulations allow for testing different candidate solutions. Unlike traditional methods, such as laboratory experiments and field observations, ABM simulation allows high-risk and infrequent scenarios to be empirically examined before applying the lessons in the real world. This is essential, as emergency communication with diverse crowds can be challenging due to language barriers, con-flicting social identities, different cultural mindsets, and crowd demographics. Improving emergency communication could therefore improve evacuations, reduce injuries, and ultimately save lives. We demonstrate this ABM method by determining the effectiveness of three communication strategies for different crowd compositions in transport terminals: (1) dynamic emergency exit floor lighting directing people to exits, (2) staff guiding people to exits with verbal and physical instructions, and (3) public announcements in English. The simulation results indicated that dynamic emergency exit floor lighting and staff guiding people to exits were only beneficial for high-density crowds and those unfamiliar with the environment. Furthermore, English public announcements actually slowed the evacuation for mainly English-speaking crowds, due to simultaneous egress causing congestion at exits, but improved evacuation speed in multicultural, multilingual crowds.

The classification task on these datasets is more time- and memory-consuming as the number of data increases. The support vector machine (SVM), which is arguably the most popular classification technique, has disappointing performance in dealing with large datasets due to its constrained optimization problem. To deal with this challenge, the variant SVM (VSVM) has been utilized which has the fraction ({1}/{2})b{2} in its primal objective function, where b is the bias of the desired hyperplane. The VSVM has been solved with different optimization techniques in more time- and memory-efficient fashion. However, there is no guarantee that its optimal solution is the same as the standard SVM. In this paper, we introduce the generalized VSVM (GVSVM) which has the fraction ({1}/{2t})b{2} in its primal objective function, for a fixed positive scalar t. Further, we present the thorough theoretical insights that indicate the optimal solution of the GVSVM tends to the optimal solution of the standard SVM as t rightarrow infty . One vital corollary is to derive a closed-form formula to obtain the bias term in the standard SVM. Such a formula obviates the need of approximating it, which is the modus operandi to date. An efficient neural network is then proposed to solve the GVSVM dual problem, which is asymptotically stable in the sense of Lyapunov and converges globally exponentially to the exact solution of the GVSVM. The proposed neural network has less complexity in architecture and needs fewer computations in each iteration in comparison to the existing neural solutions. Experiments confirm the efficacy of the proposed recurrent neural network and the proximity of the GVSVM and the standard SVM solutions with more significant values of t. © 2013 IEEE.",Convex programming; exponential convergence; generalized VSVM (GVSVM); recurrent neural network (RNN); support vector machine (SVM),Classification (of information); Constrained optimization; Iterative methods; Large dataset; Optimal systems; Recurrent neural networks; Asymptotically stable; Classification tasks; Classification technique; Closed-form formulae; Constrained optimi-zation problems; Objective functions; Optimal solutions; Optimization techniques; Support vector machines,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104454373

Concerns about potential bias, accountability and responsibility, patient autonomy and compromised trust transpire with black box algorithms. These worries connect epistemic concerns with normative issues. In this paper, we outline that black box algorithms are less problematic for epistemic reasons than many scholars seem to believe. By outlining that more transparency in algorithms is not always necessary, and by explaining that computational processes are indeed methodologically opaque to humans, we argue that the reliability of algorithms provides reasons for trusting the outcomes of medical artificial intelligence (AI). To this end, we explain how computational reliabilism, which does not require transparency and supports the reliability of algorithms, justifies the belief that results of medical AI are to be trusted. We also argue that several ethical concerns remain with black box algorithms, even when the results are trustworthy. Having justified knowledge from reliable indicators is, therefore, necessary but not sufficient for normatively justifying physicians to act. This means that deliberation about the results of reliable algorithms is required to find out what is a desirable action. Thus understood, we argue that such challenges should not dismiss the use of black box algorithms altogether but should inform the way in which these algorithms are designed and implemented. When physicians are trained to acquire the necessary skills and expertise, and collaborate with medical informatics and data scientists, black box algorithms can contribute to improving medical care. © 2021 Author(s) (or their employer(s)).

The data were analyzed by means of panel mixed logit models. Results: The prevention of deaths and financial problems of households had a very strong influence on the uptake of the app. Predicted app uptake rates ranged from 24% to 78% for the worst and best possible app for these societal effects. We found a strong positive relationship between people's trust in government and people's propensity to install the DCT app. Conclusions: The uptake levels we find are much more volatile than the uptake levels predicted in comparable studies that did not include societal effects in their discrete choice experiments. Our finding that the societal effects are a major factor in the uptake of the DCT app results in a chicken-or-the-egg causality dilemma. That is, the societal effects of the app are severely influenced by the uptake of the app, but the uptake of the app is severely influenced by its societal effects. © 2021 ISPOR–The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research",coronavirus; COVID-19; digital contact tracing app; discrete choice experiment; preferences; SARS-CoV-2; societal effects,adult; Article; contact examination; coronavirus disease 2019; death; Dutchman; female; financial stress; government; human; major clinical study; male; mobile application; Netherlands; policy; population research; priority journal; social aspect; trust; contact examination; devices; diagnosis; epidemiology; health care policy; mobile application; procedures; public health; questionnaire; social change; Contact Tracing; COVID-19; Health Policy; Humans; Mobile Applications; Netherlands; Public Health; Social Change; Surveys and Questionnaires,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102266143

A spill over the thick ice caused the least risk to whale and adult polar bears.

The current research determines the most dangerous process equipment by calculating their effects resulting from a loss of containment using DNV GL's Phast™ dispersion model. In this paper, flammable and toxic effects from a release from the main equipment of an ammonia plant have been calculated. Such an encompassing approach, which can be carried out for an entire plant, is innovative and has never been conducted before. By using this model, it has been demonstrated that the effects arising from an event of failure are the largest in process equipment containing pressurized synthesis gas and ‘warm’ liquid ammonia, meaning the ammonia buffer tanks, ammonia product pumps, and the ammonia separator. Most importantly, this document substantiates that it is possible to rank the most hazardous process equipment of the ammonia production process based on an adverse impact on humans using the calculated effect distance as a starting point for a chance of death of at least 95%. The results from the effect calculations can be used for risk mapping of an entire chemical plant or be employed and applied in a layer of protection analysis (LOPA) to establish risk mitigation measures. © 2021 The Authors",Ammonia; Bowtie; Effect; Indicator; Phast™; Process safety,Chemical analysis; Chemical plants; Liquefied gases; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Ammonia production; Dispersion modeling; Hazardous process; Layer of protection analysis; Liquid ammonia; Loss of containment; Process equipments; Risk mitigation; Ammonia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100055970

The examples from the water domain differ in terms of their primary beneficiaries and the extent to which they are prone to collective action problems.

The current sub-study raises the question whether major hazard accidents in the ammonia production process can be predicted from organizational factors, also called management delivery systems. This paper links organizational factors to accident processes and their barrier systems, using the bowtie metaphor. It is shown that organizational factors indirectly impact accident processes as they strongly influence the quality or trustworthiness of the barrier systems. By putting the right focus on organizational factors during audits or reviews, major accident processes get the attention they deserve, and the necessary actions are taken at the right management level. Qualitative and quantitative monitoring of organizational factors can provide a picture of their operation and efficiency. Using an example on retrospective data it is demonstrated that information from organizational factors could have stopped the development of the near-accident prematurely. However, organizational factors should first be qualitatively assessed before they are quantitatively monitored.

Since these consumers are too small individually to participate in the electricity markets, their assets can be pooled by an aggregator. The aggregator can implement business models by trading flexibility obtained from these consumers’ assets in different electricity markets. However, the aggregator and the consumers are only motivated to implement a business model, if it is economically feasible. The economic feasibility of a business model depends on (1) financial aspects: how much profit the aggregator makes, and how much money the consumers save, and (2) operational aspects: how the consumers’ assets are operated to increase the financial aspects. This paper aims to provide insights in these operational and financial aspects of the aggregator's business models in residential and service sectors. For this purpose, a literature review is conducted, and a framework is presented to analyze the selected papers on these operational and financial aspects. Based on this analysis, different strategies for the aggregator to implement business models are determined. Moreover, knowledge gaps are identified and several recommendations for future research are provided. © 2021 The Authors",Aggregator; Business model; Demand response; Energy storage; Flexibility; Renewable energy sources,Housing; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Business modeling; Economic feasibilities; Financial aspects; Literature reviews; Operational aspects; Renewable energy source; Service sectors; Uncertainty and variability; Service industry,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099195962

However, such a perspective may exclude stakeholders with a negative social performance which are cooperating with a factory but are not directly involved with the product under study, and it can result in a step back on corporate social responsibility (CSR). Our study aimed to align S-LCA with the CSR concept. Therefore, we designed a case study for the manufacturing sector in which we practiced expanding the system boundaries of S-LCA. Our results showed larger social risks after expanding the system boundaries due to subsidiary and supplier companies located in countries with less strict regulations than the Netherlands, which is where the main organizations and parent company existed. We conclude that system boundaries expansion can result in more complete picture of the involved organizations, and lead practitioners to approach S-LCA with the goal of improving social conditions and identify companies which deserve excellent or poor social scores. Its usefulness is mostly expected when S-LCA practitioners aim to identify social hotspots in supply chains in socially sensitive markets. © 2020",Corporate social responsibility; Human rights; Parental liability; Social life cycle assessment; Subsidiary,Artificial life; Chemical industry; Economic and social effects; Laws and legislation; Supply chains; Chemical process industry; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Manufacturing sector; Social conditions; Social performance; System boundary; Life cycle; chemical industry; corporate social responsibility; human rights; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; social impact; stakeholder; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098942165

In this paper, I will first argue that the control principle should be restrained to blameworthiness, because responsibility is too wide a concept to square with control. Many deniers of moral luck appeal to the intuitiveness of the control principle. Defenders of moral luck do not share this intuition and demand a stronger defence of the control principle. I will establish a defence of the control principle based on the value of simplicity for selecting a theory of blameworthiness. A simpler theory of blameworthiness is more likely to be true, and not being falsely judged blameworthy is desirable. I will conclude that simplicity advices the acceptance of the control principle over other theories of blameworthiness that embrace factors beyond control. © 2020, The Author(s).",Blame; Blameworthiness; Control principle; Moral luck; Simplicity,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087964659

Biomass is a renewable source of energy that has played a very important role in energy production in recent years. Because there are a number of technologies that can be used to convert biomass into energy, it is important to select the best option. The fact that multiple options are available that need to be evaluated based on a set of decision-making criteria makes this a multicriteria decision-making problem. This paper takes the first step in proposing an evaluation framework and identifying the importance of the relevant decision-making criteria in biofuel production technology selection. To determine the importance of the selection criteria, experts were asked to respond to an online questionnaire based on the best-worst method. The results indicate that air pollution, land use change, and human expertise are the three most important criteria for selecting the best biofuel production technology in our case country, Iran. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Best-worst method (BWM); biofuel production technology; biomass; renewable energy; sustainability assessment framework,Biomass; Decision making; Economics; Fossil fuels; Land use; Production; Surveys; Sustainable development; Biofuel production; Decision making criteria; Environmental problems; Evaluation framework; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Renewable energies; Sustainability assessment; Use of renewable energies; Biofuels,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065423535

In which case, there might already be a problem with the legacy installation, or even a crisis, without having had an accident. When the hazard cannot be taken away, the question arises as to how much effort, if any, should be spent on improving the situation. The usefulness of the three archetypical approaches to this problem: setting a standard, the as low as reasonably practicable approach and a case-by-case discourse approach are discussed for their applicability for these legacy risks. Although it would be desirable to retrofit legacy risks to previously set legal requirements as is the case when acceptability limits are set in law or demonstration of ALARP (As Low As Reasonably Achievable) is demanded, it may be impossible to reduce the residual risk to an otherwise acceptable level without taking away or replacing the infrastructure, which is not acceptable either. Therefore in conclusion the only available solution to persistent legacy risk problems seems to be to have a thorough discussion with all relevant stakeholders until an agreement is in some way found. © 2021 by the authors.

These periurban interfaces are spaces of flows, shaped by an exchange of matter, people and ideas between urban and rural spaces—and currently they are zones in transition. Periur-banisation processes result inter alia in changing water demands and changing relations between water and society. In this paper the concept of the hydrosocial cycle is applied to interpret the transformation of the waterscapes of six periurban villages in the fringe areas of Pune, Hyderabad and Kolkata. In doing so, three specific aspects will be investigated: (1) the institutions shaping the hydro-social cycle, (2) the interplay between water as a livelihood-base and the waterscape, (3) the interplay between the waterscape and water as a consumption good. This approach opens new views on periurban interfaces as emerging mosaic of unique waterscapes. The meaning of water, the rights to access water and the water related infrastructure are constantly renegotiated, as permanently new water demands emerge and new actors enter the scene. Especially this process-based understanding links the theoretical lens of the hydrosocial cycle with the object of investigation, the periurban space. © 2021 by the authors.

Particularly, Scientific Workflow Scheduling (SWFS) accelerates the computational procedures between the available computational resources and the dependent workflow jobs based on the researchers' requirements. However, cost optimization is one of the SWFS challenges in handling massive and complicated tasks and requires determining an approximate (near-optimal) solution within polynomial computational time. Motivated by this, current work proposes a novel SWFS cost optimization model effective in solving this challenge. The proposed model contains three main stages: (i) scientific workflow application, (ii) targeted computational environment, and (iii) cost optimization criteria. The model has been used to optimize completion time (makespan) and overall computational cost of SWFS in cloud computing for all considered scenarios in this research context. This will ultimately reduce the cost for service consumers. At the same time, reducing the cost has a positive impact on the profitability of service providers towards utilizing all computational resources to achieve a competitive advantage over other cloud service providers. To evaluate the effectiveness of this proposed model, an empirical comparison was conducted by employing three core types of heuristic approaches, including Single-based (i.e., Genetic Algorithm (GA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), and Invasive Weed Optimization (IWO)), Hybrid-based (i.e., Hybrid-based Heuristics Algorithms (HIWO)), and Hyper-based (i.e., Dynamic Hyper-Heuristic Algorithm (DHHA)). Additionally, a simulation-based implementation was used for SIPHT SWFA by considering three different sizes of datasets. The proposed model provides an efficient platform to optimally schedule workflow tasks by handling data-intensiveness and computational-intensiveness of SWFAs. The results reveal that the proposed cost optimization model attained an optimal Job completion time (makespan) and total computational cost for small and large sizes of the considered dataset. In contrast, hybrid and hyper-based approaches consistently achieved better results for the medium-sized dataset. © 2021 Tech Science Press.

Findings on the sharing economy suggest that accommodation sharing increases long-distance travel; bikesharing is conducive to more active travel and lower car use; carsharing may reduce private car use and ownership; ridesourcing (ridehailing) may increase vehicle miles traveled; while the implications of e-scooter sharing, ridesharing, and Mobility as a Service are context-dependent.

However, public support is typically very low and therefore very few charging schemes have been implemented. The concept of tradable peak credits (TPC), which is based on the cap-and-trade principle, has characteristics that are believed to lead to more public support. First, a TPC system is revenue-neutral since the money circulates within the user group. Also, the expected effectiveness, and thereby support, may be higher because, in a TPC system, the operator has more control over the inflow of cars due to the firm cap. Lastly, the allocation of free credits provides the opportunity to address equity issues. This paper aims to quantify the levels of support for TPC among the public and to explore what the influence of scheme design, personal characteristics and attitudes is on these levels of support. To that end, a stated choice experiment has been conducted in which respondents were asked whether they would vote for the implementation of different TPC schemes. The discrete choice model shows that 32%, and up to a small majority of 52%, would support different TPC schemes. Most people, however, like or dislike TPC regardless of the scheme design. It is attitudes, and to a limited extent also socio-demographics, that relate to someone's level of support, rather than the scheme characteristics.

Traditionally, inferentialism is combined with a deflationary attitude towards semantic terms such as truth and reference, i.e., many inferentialists hold that when we use these semantic terms we do not purport to refer to substantive properties. This combination makes inferentialism attractive for philosophers who see themselves as antirealists. Although the attractions of combining inferentialism and deflationism are easy to see, deflationism is also a controversial position. For one, deflationists maintain that truth is an insubstantive property, but it is not altogether clear what an insubstantive property is. Secondly, as deflationists maintain that truth does not play an explanatory role, it is incompatible with the position that truth can explain the normativity of truth talk. Given that deflationism faces these objections, it would be preferable if the success of inferentialism did not depend on the deflationist’s ability to respond to these objections. I argue that someone attracted to inferentialism for its ability to accommodate antirealist intuitions about a domain (e.g. morality) is not committed to deflationism about truth. More specifically, I will show that inferentialism combined with a straightforward account of inferentialist truth-conditions is compatible with a version of truth pluralism. I call this position Inferentialist Truth Pluralism. © 2021, The Author(s).",Conceptual role semantics; Deflationism; Inferentialism; Metasemantics; Minimalism; Truth pluralism,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100351051

However, a modest, yet, growing stream in institutional analysis aims to move away from ‘merely describing the characteristics’ of institutions (i.e., form variables) to ‘performance or quality measures’ (i.e., function variables). Following this line of argument, the credibility thesis as put forward in this journal (Ho, 2014) postulates that the form of institutions is unrelated to their performance, and institutions are unintentional outcomes rather than designed artefacts. The primary goal of this research is to ascertain whether this dual prediction could be observed in a simulation model that is driven by agent behaviour and interaction, resulting in emerging institutions. We devise an empirically verified agent-based model within a classical thought experiment on a common property resource to validate the thesis’ predictions. First, our model confirms that different forms of institutions can have a similar performance. Second, we ascertain that successful institutions in difficult management situations can emerge (rather than being designed) that are beneficial for the sustainability of the common resource and the appropriators of that resource. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modeling (ABM); Common pool resource; Common property; Credibility thesis; Endogeneity and emergence; Institutional function; Socio-ecological systems (SES),common property resource; computer simulation; empirical analysis; institutional framework; numerical model; prediction,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099630359

Various performance loss and recovery behaviors have been observed for WDSs subject to disruptions. However, a model for their characterization, which could provide further insight for resilience assessment and enhancement, is still lacking. Here, the authors develop a recovery function to model WDS performance over time following a disruption. This function is useful to compare system responses under different disruption and recovery scenarios and supports the identification of areas for improvement within various aspects of the resilience of a WDS. The proposed model was applied to two benchmark networks. Different scenarios were analyzed in which one node at a time was disrupted and two recovery strategies were implemented. It was found that the developed model supports the implementation of tailored strategies to improve WDS resilience according to the location of the disruption, therefore enhancing the efficient allocation of resources. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Recovery; Benchmark networks; Developed model; Efficient allocations; Performance loss; Quantitative assessments; Recovery functions; Recovery strategies; Water distribution system (WDSs); Water distribution systems; assessment method; quantitative analysis; resource management; water management; water planning; water resource,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099402030

In order to support this goal, this study examines the effect of security and privacy on IoT device purchase behaviour and assesses whether these effects are sensitive to framing, using a mixed methods approach. The first part of the study focuses on quantifying the effect of security and privacy compared to the effect of other device attributes such as price or functionality, by testing a causal model with choice models that have been developed from stated choice data. The second part aims to reveal the underlying mechanisms that determine the effect of privacy and security on purchase behaviour by means of a qualitative survey. The results suggest that security and privacy can strongly affect purchase behaviour, under the circumstances that privacy- and security-related information is available and communicated in an understandable manner, allowing consumers to compare devices. Moreover, the results show that a description of security that focuses on gains is more effective in nudging consumers towards buying secure devices. Future efforts could build upon this study by comparing the effect of security and privacy to more device attributes, such as ease of use or cost reduction. The results can serve as a basis for interventions that nudge consumers towards buying more secure and privacy-friendly devices. © 2020",Choice modelling; IoT; Privacy; Public policy; Purchasing behaviour; Security,Cost reduction; Sales; Choice model; Internet of Things (IOT); Privacy and security; Purchase decision; Qualitative surveys; Secure devices; Security and privacy; Stated choice; Internet of things,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097755208

A release of multi-hazard materials can simultaneously or sequentially lead to acute toxicity, fire and explosion. The spatial-temporal evolution of hazards may also result in cascading effects. In this study, a dynamic methodology called “Dynamic Graph Monte Carlo” (DGMC) is developed to model the evolution of multi-hazard accident scenarios and assess the vulnerability of humans and installations exposed to such hazards. In the DGMC model, chemical plants are modeled as a multi-agent system with three kinds of agents: hazardous installations, ignition sources, and humans while considering the uncertainties and interdependencies among the agents and their impacts on the evolution of hazards and possible escalation effects. A case study is analyzed using the DGMC methodology, demonstrating that the risk can be underestimated if the spatial-temporal evolution of multi-hazard scenarios is neglected.

However, both large-scale processing of personal data and aggregated product choices may carry collective risks for society. In such situations, governance arrangements implying individual responsibility are at odds with uncertain collective risks from new technologies. We, therefore, investigate the governance challenges of what we call risk personalization: a form of governance for dealing with uncertain collective risks that allocates responsibility for governing those risks to individuals. We situate risk personalization at the intersection of two trends: governance of uncertain risk, and emphasis on individual responsibility. We then analyze three cases selected based on diversity: social media, nanomaterials, and Uber. Cross-case comparison highlights issues of risk personalization pertaining to (i) the nature of the risk, (ii) governance arrangements in place, and (iii) mechanisms for allocating responsibility to individuals. We identify governance challenges in terms of (i) meaningful choice, (ii) effectiveness in mitigating risk, and (iii) collective decision making capacity. We conclude that the risk personalization lens stimulates reflection on the effectiveness and legitimacy of risk governance in light of individual agency. © 2020 The Authors.

In several countries, it is forbidden to influence the grid imbalances in order to let the TSO retain full control of grid regulation. In this paper, we argue that this approach is not optimal as market actors that trade imbalances under the supervision of the TSO can help balancing the grid more efficiently. For instance, some systems such as solar farms cannot participate in the standard balancing market but do have economic incentives to help regulate the grid by trading with imbalances. Based on this argument, we propose a new market framework where any market actor is allowed to trade with imbalances. We show that, using the new market mechanism, the TSO can keep full control of the grid balance while decreasing the balancing cost. This is of primary importance as: 1) novel approaches to reduce grid imbalances are needed as, while renewable sources are generally not used for grid balancing, the increasing integration of renewable energy sources creates higher imbalances. 2) While long-term storage of energy is key in the energy transition, it needs to become an attractive investment to ensure its widespread use; as we show, the proposed market can guarantee that. Based on a real case study, we show that the new market can provide 10–20% of the total balancing energy needed and reduce the balancing costs. © 2020 The Authors",Balancing services; Grid balancing; Imbalance market; Imbalance trading; Market framework; Renewable sources; Seasonal storage systems,Commerce; Energy storage; Renewable energy resources; Balancing reserves; Economic incentive; Energy transitions; Integration of renewable energies; Long-term storage; Market mechanisms; Renewable sources; Transmission system operators; Investments,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094146886

I call this second interpretation the description of patterns of behavior viewpoint of computer simulations (DPB). This article explores these two interpretations of computer simulations from three different angles. First, I collect a series of definitions of computer simulation from the historical record. I track back definitions to the early 1960s and show how each viewpoint shares similar interpretations of computer simulations—ultimately clustering into the two viewpoints aforementioned. This reconstruction also includes the most recent literature. Second, I unpack the philosophical assumptions behind each viewpoint, with a special emphasis on their differences.

There are, however, doubts about whether municipalities are an adequate organization and scale level for this. In this context, the article aims to picture developments of local young technology firms in bringing energy inventions to market, in particular, how municipalities have provided support to them. Such aim, in the context of energy transition, is new. Derived from study in Nordic countries and The Netherlands, two findings make a valuable contribution to literature. Firstly, a share of almost 40% of young technology firms fails in market introduction, and if reached the market, a 30% is rather late. Barriers stem from high risk-taking, late (no) collaboration, and limiting circumstances in metropolitan cities. Secondly, municipalities’ initiatives appear useful in filling young technology firms’ needs, but the initiatives are fragmented and miss priority. However, partnering in professional start-up organizations tends to improve the situation, indicating that the municipal level is promising in transitional change with regard to new technology. In contrast, driving energy transition through regional cluster building, includes different levels of functional interdependence, territorial scale, networking and governance, causing manifold complexity and uncertainty. Not all (large) municipalities seem able to act in a promising manner, however, much empirical research needs to be done. © 2021 by the authors.

Cooperation on transboundary water management is critical, particularly because it concerns issues across multiple states, SDGs and targets regarding agriculture, energy, ecosystems, climate adaptation, health, and peace and security. The percentage of transboundary basin area within a country that has an “operational arrangement” for water cooperation is used as the main indicator of such cooperation in the SDGs for “equitable and reasonable use“ of water resources (SDG 6.5.2). However, no clear criteria and explanation are available for what exactly constitutes an “equitable and reasonable use” in any such “operational arrangements.” Furthermore, it is understandable that any such arrangements may be shaped by differences in historical, legal, and political contexts and hence may be inherently unjust. Here, we highlight the limitations of SDG indicators, particularly SDG 6.5.2, to monitor equity of resource sharing in transboundary river systems. Using Walzer’s theory of morality of the state and cosmopolitanism as a framework, we examine the Nile basin as a case study to demonstrate the shortcomings of current SDG criteria and indicators.

Such studies are often based on the utilitarian principle, where the criticality of a segment is assessed based on its contribution to the aggregate performance of the transport system. To allow for the use of alternative moral principles, I systematically operationalize concepts from the transport equity literature into an equity-based criticality analysis framework. There are two main ideas in this framework: calculation of equity-weighted transport demand based on distributive moral principles and adaptation of an equity-weighted user equilibrium assignment algorithm. Using the Bangladesh freight transport network as a case study, I show that different sets of transport segments emerge as being critical when different moral principles are used. The use of some pairs of moral principles, for example global equalization and proportionality, even produces a negative ranking correlation. This implies that links which are considered to be critical based on one principle are not at all critical based on the other one. Selection of a moral principle, either explicitly or implicitly, is an inevitable step in transport network criticality analysis. Hence, it is advised to use multiple moral principles or to make a deliberative selection of a moral principle, as considering alternative moral principles in a criticality analysis could expose previously overlooked transport segments. © 2020 The Author(s)",Criticality; Equity; Justice; Transport network; Vulnerability,Criticality (nuclear fission); Aggregate performance; Criticality analysis; Freight transport; Ranking correlation; Transport demand; Transport networks; Transport systems; User equilibrium assignment; Freight transportation; algorithm; demand analysis; equity; freight transport; performance assessment; transportation system; travel demand; vulnerability; Bangladesh,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099260854

In a PVE, individuals select their preferred portfolio of government projects given a constrained public budget. Individuals’ preferences for (the impacts of) government projects can be determined based on these choices. The obtained preferences can be used to rank government projects in terms of their desirability. Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA) is an alternative appraisal method used to assess the desirability of government projects. CBA establishes the desirability of public projects through analyzing people's trade-offs between their private income and impacts of public projects. The primary objective of this paper is to investigate whether CBA and PVE lead to different policy recommendations in the context of urban mobility investments. We conducted CBAs and a PVE for 16 urban mobility investment projects and find indicative evidence that projects which focus on improving traffic safety and improvements for cyclists/pedestrians rank higher in the PVE, whereas car projects rank higher in the CBA analysis. © 2020 The Authors",Cost benefit analysis; Participation; Participatory value evaluation; Transport appraisal; Transport planning,Budget control; Costs; Economic and social effects; Investments; Appraisal method; Government projects; Investment projects; Policy recommendations; Primary objective; Public project; Urban mobility; Value evaluations; Cost benefit analysis; cost-benefit analysis; investment; mobility; participatory approach; transportation development; transportation planning; urban transport,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098684895

However, relatively little is known about the actual implementation of programs to achieve sustainable cities, especially how combinations of policy instruments are deployed in the realisation of low carbon cities. First, this study contributes to the literature in policy studies by identifying how four types relevant to carbon city development, hierarchy, market, network and information based ones, can be combined in policy mixes and play out in the effective realisation of low carbon cities in other countries. Second, this framework is used to map the application of policy instruments in China's 35 low carbon pilot cities. This study uses fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to explore which configurations of policy instruments are in use and assesses their effects on low carbon city construction. It thus builds a bridge between theory on policy instruments, their combinations and low carbon city development. The presence of hierarchical policy instruments appears to be a necessary condition for low carbon city development and their use prevails. Market-based and network-based instruments complement hierarchical instruments but do not suffice in themselves. Applying hierarchical instruments and market-based instruments together tends to hamper the effect of network instruments and information instruments, whereas network instruments appear to be interchangeable with information instruments. Network governance in China's low carbon city development is still comparatively underdeveloped. © 2020",fsQCA; Hierarchy; Information; Low carbon cities; Market; Network; Policy instruments,Climate change; Commerce; Environmental management; Urban growth; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Hierarchical policy; Information instruments; Market-based instruments; Network governances; Network-based instruments; Policy instruments; Sustainable cities; Carbon,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097461726

Nevertheless, the interaction between the markets for oilseeds (food/feed/bioenergy) and liquid vegetable oil-based biofuels is overwhelmingly complex and thus not well understood. In this study, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model to provide insights into the effect of farmers' behaviour on trade flows and biodiesel production and to shed light on the influence of import tariffs for both palm oil and biodiesel on system behaviour. This new approach enables us to assess different types of rational economic behaviour for the adoption of crops by farmers. Results show that model outcomes can vary substantially based on the assumptions made concerning the behaviour of farmers. Moreover, we found that biodiesel trade and production are more sensitive to a change in the EU-28's biodiesel import tariff than to a change in the EU-28's palm oil import tariff. Overall, our results show that social processes, actors' heterogeneity, and institutions play an important role in the behaviour of the system. © 2020 The Authors",Agent-based modelling (ABM); Economic behaviour farmers; International trade flows; Liquid biofuels; Policy exploration,Agriculture; Autonomous agents; Biodiesel; Computational methods; Palm oil; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Agent-based modelling; Biodiesel production; Biofuel production; Liquid biofuels; New approaches; Social process; Spatially explicit; International trade; biofuel; European Union; international trade; modeling; trade flow; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097051054

This article develops a simulation model that draws on current theory of standards competition dynamics and represents the interplay of strategic factors that firms can use to gain a competitive advantage. The model is used to reproduce four published cases of standards competition and explore alternative outcomes. Simulation results align with the published cases and show that the competition outcome arises from the systemic effect of all the factors identified in the original studies. Further simulation tests explore under which conditions competition outcomes could have been different. The model, thus, provides a basis for further theoretical and empirical work on strategic aspects of standards competition in the respective industries of the cases. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Competition; dominant designs; platforms; retroduction; standards; system dynamics,Electrical engineering; Engineering; Competitive advantage; Number of factors; On currents; Simulation model; Simulation tests; Standards competitions; Strategic factors; System dynamics model; Competition,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085745202

In recent decades, the call to reverse these negative impacts by re-operating dams has become stronger. Dams can support riverine ecosystems by releasing environmental flows (e-flows). Unfortunately, despite the development of numerous methodologies to determine e-flows and optimise dam releases, actual implementation has not followed suit. Integrating e-flow requirements in the design of new dams is relatively easier than changing operations of existing dams; however, re-operating existing dams is essential to restore ecosystems and ecosystem services that have already been affected by the construction and operation of dams. This study provides insights into how e-flows evolve from recommendation to practice through a systematic literature review on practical experiences to integrate e-flows in dam operations. Sixty-nine cases of successful dam re-operation have been identified, ranging from the well-documented case of the Glen Canyon Dam in the United States to less known cases such as the Katse Dam in Lesotho. We find that the most important factors that facilitate the successful implementation of e-flows are the existence of e-flows legislation or policy, the development of a research base in the form of an environmental impact study, and then flow experimentation. Illustrations of the important role of collaboration between various stakeholders and set timelines for implementation of recommendations are also given. These insights will inform how existing dams can be re-operated and governed more equitably and sustainably for both humans and the environment. © 2020 The Authors.

The first consideration for implementing IS in a cluster is to identify technical opportunities for exchanging waste material and or energy. However, the definition and methods for assessing the technical potential of IS are not elaborated in the literature. This research proposes a method to evaluate IS potential that considers different system boundaries. The method allows for explicitly reflecting current and expected developments at plant and cluster level. The suggested method was applied to the Persian Gulf Mining and Metals Special Economic Zone (PGSEZ) in Iran. The case study shows that expanding the system boundaries to include the waste flows inside steelmaking and direct reduction plants could result in an 8% increase in available waste heat. Heat recovery possibilities outside the cluster boundaries offered 118 MW cooling plus 368 MW heating potential compared to 158 MW demand for electricity in the cluster. Furthermore, less than 20% of generated by-products could currently be reused in the cluster, while theoretically all by-products could be utilized today in other industries such as cement and ceramic. These findings support the use of IS as a way to open new perspectives for EIC development policies. © 2020 The Author(s)",Emerging industrial cluster; Industrial symbiosis; Technical potential,Cement industry; Ceramics industry; Waste heat; Cluster boundaries; Development policies; Direct reduction plant; Industrial cluster; Industrial symbiosis; Metal industries; Special economic zones; Technical potential; Industrial economics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095813551

To study the impact of such measures on inter-municipality traffic, we analyze a mobile dataset with the daily flow of people in Portugal in March and April 2020. We find that the reduction in inter-municipality traffic depends strongly on its initial outflow. In municipalities where the mobility is low, the outflow reduced by 10-20% and this decrease was independent of the population size. Whereas, for municipalities of high mobility, the reduction was a monotonic increasing function of the population size and it even exceeded 60% for the largest municipalities. As a consequence of such heterogeneities, there were significant structural changes on the most probable paths for the spreading of the virus, which must be considered when modeling the impact of control measures. © 2021 authors.

Different from other oil and gas supply infrastructures, oil and gas pipelines may be more vulnerable to accidental, natural and intentional threats due to their widespread distribution. Therefore a systematic and thorough review is carried out to investigate safety and security of oil and gas pipelines based on bibliometric analysis. First, a total of 598 publications between 1970 and 2019 related to safety and security of oil and natural gas pipelines was retrieved and refined from the database of Web of Science (WoS). The 598 publications are analyzed by the bibliometric software VOSviewer to obtain the temporal and regional distribution of publications, to identify “productive institutions” and “productive authors”, and create the cooperation networks between institutions and authors. Besides, the evolution of research topics and research methods are identified based on keywords and bibliographic analysis. Moreover, the main research topics and research methods are analyzed to obtain insight into the research evolutions and trends. Risk assessment, leakage, and corrosion are the main topics while QRA, fuzzy theory and the Bayesian network are the most frequently used research methods. To further improve the sustainability of oil and gas pipelines, this study provides and discusses future research needs such as pipeline security, environmental sustainability, pipeline system resilience. According to these results, the research on risk assessment based on Bayesian network and consequence analysis using CFD may increase in the future. Besides, more research and guidelines on pipeline security, resilience, and environmental impacts to better protect pipelines, are expected. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Bibliometric analysis; Oil and gas pipelines; Research evolution; Safety and security; Sustainable transportation,Bayesian networks; Corrosion; Environmental impact; Gas supply; Gases; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gasoline plants; Petroleum transportation; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bibliographic analysis; Bibliometric analysis; Consequence analysis; Cooperation networks; Environmental sustainability; Oil-and-Gas pipelines; Regional distribution; Safety and securities; Petroleum refining,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089951559

New technologies and regulations are being introduced with increasing speed. The ability to adapt to these changes is crucial for the economic success of the maritime sector. However, the sector is challenged by inertia due to its global nature and long-life assets (e.g., vessels). These developments result in a globally projected greenhouse gas emission growth rather than a reduction towards 2050. The sector can be considered essential to economic prosperity, but its innovation system should align with global sustainability trends. This article aims to structure and evaluate the maritime sector’s systemic challenges by conducting an extensive systematic review of (sustainable) maritime innovation literature.

Dividing the problem into territories enables drivers to carry out the same route every week so they get familiar with it and residents put out their bins at the appropriate time. Another benefit is to reduce the computation time for large problems, since the complex characteristics of the involved vehicle routing problem make it otherwise difficult to solve. There are three characteristics that are important for good territory planning: minimum overlap, minimum travel time, and balanced workload. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the influence these three objectives have on each other, since they might be contradictory. Moreover, an Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) algorithm is developed for this specific problem which uses a K-means algorithm to generate the initial solution for territories.

Recent Findings: Bioethanol is seen as a potential near-term source of negative emissions, with CO2 transport as the main cost limitation. The paper industry is a current source of biogenic CO2, but complex CO2 capture configurations raise costs and limit BECCS potential. Remuneration for stored biogenic CO2 is needed to incentivise BECCS in these sectors. BECCS could also be used for carbon–neutral production of steel, cement, and chemicals, but these will likely require substantial incentives to become cost-competitive. While negative emissions may be possible from all industries considered, the overall CO2 balance is highly sensitive to biomass supply chains. Furthermore, the resource intensity of biomass cultivation and energy production for CO2 capture risks burden-shifting to other environmental impacts. Summary: Research on BECCS-in-industry is limited but growing, and estimates of costs and environmental impacts vary widely. While negative emissions are possible, transparent presentation of assumptions, system boundaries, and results is needed to increase comparability. In particular, the mixing of avoided emissions and physical storage of atmospheric CO2 creates confusion of whether physical negative emissions occur. More attention is needed to the geographic context of BECCS-in-industry outside of Europe, the USA, and Brazil, taking into account local biomass supply chains and CO2 storage siting, and minimise burden-shifting. © 2021, The Author(s).",BECCS; Cement; CO2 capture; Ethanol; Negative emissions; Paper; Steel,,Review,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116270336

Most existing weighting methods are based on judgments by experts/decision-makers, which are prone to several cognitive biases, making it necessary to examine these biases in MADM weighting methods and develop debiasing strategies. This study uses experimental analysis to look at equalizing bias—one of the main cognitive biases, where decision-makers tend to assign the same weight to different attributes—in MADM methods. More specifically, we look at AHP (analytic hierarchy process), BWM (best-worst method), PA (point allocation), SMART (simple multiattribute rating technique), and Swing methods under two structuring formats, hierarchical and non-hierarchical. To empirically examine the existence of equalizing bias in these methods, we formulate several hypotheses, which are tested using a public transportation mode selection problem among 146 university students. The results indicate that AHP and BWM have less equalizing bias than SMART, Swing, and PA, and that the hierarchical problem structuring leads to a reduction in the equalizing bias in all five methods and that such a reduction significantly varies among the methods. Our findings prove some debiasing strategies suggested in existing literature, which could be used by real decision-makers (when selecting a method) as well as researchers (when developing new methods). © 2021 The Authors.

We investigated spatiotemporal patterns of typhoon storm surge disasters based on their tropical cyclone track clusters to support disaster mitigation in China. We aggregated 172 typhoon storm surge disasters in the entire cluster. Then, we used the extended Finite-Mixture-Model to categorize these 172 disasters into three clusters according to their track clusters (westward, northward, and westward shift at the coastline). In general, not all temporal distributions of the frequency and damage showed significant trends in the entire cluster and three clusters from 1983–2018. Between 1983‒2000 and 2001‒2018, the average annual frequency increased, and average annual direct economic loss and average annual fatalities decreased in the entire cluster. Although most temporal patterns in the three clusters were similar to those in the entire cluster, a positive growth ratio in the average annual direct economic loss was apparent between 1983‒2000 and 2001‒2018 in Cluster 3. For spatial patterns, southern and eastern regions were more affected by typhoon storm surge disasters than northern regions. In northern regions, Cluster 2 recorded the most disaster occurrences, direct economic losses, and fatalities. Track characteristics and mitigation measures were introduced to help understand disaster spatiotemporal patterns in the entire cluster and three clusters. © 2021 The Author(s).

Combinations of measures targeting the transportation sector and other aspects of social life have been implemented with varying degrees of success in different countries. This paper proposes a classification of COVID-19 measures aimed at passenger mobility. We distinguish the categories “avoidance of travel”, “modal shift” and “improvement of quality”. Per category, we distinguish different types of measures and effects (social, economic and environmental). Next, we review the literature on COVID-19 measures for passenger mobility, after which we discuss the policy relevance of our findings and propose a research agenda. We conclude that broad or integral assessments of measures on all socially relevant effects are rare. Also, few studies exist to determine the effects of individual measures and deal with combinations of measures instead. Studies on social or economic effects focus on partial direct effects (e.g. turnover of the transport sector, effect of mobility measures on commuter traffic) and do not elaborate on indirect effects (e.g. changes in household expenditure, stress levels). Finally, there is a greater focus in the literature on intermediary health indicators (e.g. travel behaviour) but less on the actual spread of COVID-19 or indeed on other indirect health effects of measures (e.g. due to air pollution, more exercise, etc). © 2021 The Author(s).

Further, it opens avenues for practice, which together with research requires adaptation in teaching curricula if policy education were to remain relevant. However, it is not clear to what extent this opportunity is being realized in public policy research and teaching. In this study, we examine the prevalence of big data analytics in public policy research and pedagogy using bibliometric analysis and topic modeling for the former, and content analysis of course titles and descriptions for the latter. We find that despite significant scope for application of various big data techniques, the use of these analytic techniques in public policy has been largely limited to select institutions in a few countries. Further, data science has received limited attention in policy pedagogy, once again with significant geographic variation in its prevalence.

Typically, the individuals are not overtly rational and do not select, but rather inherit their traits. Cancer can be framed as such an evolutionary game, as it is composed of cells of heterogeneous types undergoing frequency-dependent selection. In this article, we first summarize existing works where evolutionary game theory has been employed in modeling cancer and improving its treatment. Some of these game-theoretic models suggest how one could anticipate and steer cancer’s eco-evolutionary dynamics into states more desirable for the patient via evolutionary therapies. Such therapies offer great promise for increasing patient survival and decreasing drug toxicity, as demonstrated by some recent studies and clinical trials. We discuss clinical relevance of the existing game-theoretic models of cancer and its treatment, and opportunities for future applications. Moreover, we discuss the developments in cancer biology that are needed to better utilize the full potential of game-theoretic models. Ultimately, we demonstrate that viewing tumors with evolutionary game theory has medically useful implications that can inform and create a lockstep between empirical findings and mathematical modeling. We suggest that cancer progression is an evolutionary competition between different cell types and therefore needs to be viewed as an evolutionary game. © 2021, The Author(s).",Competitive release; Eco-evolutionary dynamics; Evolutionary game theory; Genetics; Resistance; Stackelberg evolutionary games,,Review,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113857884

However, staying silent is not always feasible. In situations where opinions are indirectly expressed by one’s observable actions, people may however try to hide their opinions via a more complex and intelligent strategy called obfuscation, which minimizes the information disclosed to others. This study proposes a formal opinion dynamics model to study the hitherto unexplored effect of obfuscation on public opinion formation based on the recently developed Action-Opinion Inference Model. For illustration purposes, we use our model to simulate two cases with different levels of complexity, highlighting that the effect of obfuscation largely depends on the subtle relations between actions and opinions. © 2021 The Author(s).

By broadcasting packets to their bus, the CAN facilitates the interaction between Electronic Control Units (ECU) that coordinate, monitor and control internal vehicle components. With no authentication mechanism for identifying the legitimacy and source of packets, CAN are vulnerable to cyber-attacks. An Intrusion Detection System (IDS) can detect attacks on CAN and machine learning can be used to create the models for the IDSs to detect non-linear attack patterns. However, car manufacturers and owners might want to keep the sensitive information required for training the models confidential. Therefore, we proposed a Blockchain-based Federated Forest Software-Defined Networking (SDN)-enabled IDS (BFF-IDS) to address the problem of data sharing the sensitive CAN data. To ensure scalability, we used InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) to host the models, and the blockchain is designed to store only a hash of the model and a pointer to its location. The SDN provides the dynamic routing of packets and model exchanges. We used Federated Learning (FL) to create a random forest model. Individuals provide partially trained models, allowing them to keep the underlying data confidential. Using Fourier transform, we decomposed the CAN IDs cycle from CAN bus traffic in the frequency domain for better generalization in multiclass detection of attacks. Multiple statistical and entropy features were extracted to handle the high complexity and non-linearity in CAN bus traffic. The proposed system allows manufacturers and car owners to contribute to the training of the models, as their sensitive data is protected. By storing hashes of the models on a blockchain, the risk of adversaries poisoning the models is reduced and a single point of failure is avoided. We evaluated the proposed system by conducting experiments on a testbed. We found that the proposed system has efficient use of memory and CPU resources and that the detection rate of closely related attacks was high. We recorded the highest model attack detection rate of about 0.981. © 2013 IEEE.",Blockchain; CAN; federated learning; in-vehicle network; intrusion detection system; random forest; SDN,Automobile manufacture; Blockchain; Computer crime; Control system synthesis; Controllers; Data privacy; Data Sharing; Decision trees; Frequency domain analysis; Intrusion detection; Network security; Vehicle to vehicle communications; Vehicles; Authentication mechanisms; Controller area network; Electronic control units; In-vehicle communication; Intrusion Detection Systems; Random forest modeling; Sensitive informations; Software defined networking (SDN); Learning systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85111598504

An upcoming paradigm for innovation in this system is that of the Physical Internet (PI). This highly advanced way of shipping will present a very different logistics environment with respective challenges for maritime ports. For those investing in or operating port systems, it is important to understand whether different service quality aspects will be important in this future system, compared to today. Our paper deals with the port performance evaluation and selection problem. Although it has been studied extensively in a contemporary context, there has been no exploration of the criteria and preferences of decision-makers in the future shipping environment of the PI. Our objective is to define these criteria and explore their weighting in this new context. We propose two distinct autonomous decision-makers for port performance evaluation and selection in the PI: intelligent containers and vessels. We identify future port performance evaluation and selection criteria, and analyse their weighting based on an expert survey, complementing the extant literature on port performance evaluation and selection and the PI. We use the Bayesian Best-Worst Method (BWM) to derive weights for the criteria. We find that, compared to the current port performance evaluation and selection literature, in a first stage in the modelling of intelligent agents’ performance preferences, subtle differences in weights mark the step from the present towards the PI. Partly, this is reassuring for port authorities as they can manage largely the same set of performance indicators to be attractive for both decision-makers. However, the results also show differences between agents, with an increased importance of, in particular, Level of Service, Network Interconnectivity, and Information Systems. © 2021 The Author(s)",Best-worst method; Intelligent agents; Multi-criteria decision-analysis; Physical internet; Port performance evaluation; Port selection,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85110651261

Moral progress depends at least in part on the possibility of individual people improving their moral cognition to eliminate the pernicious influence of various epistemically defective biases and other distorting factors. Since the degree of control people can exert over their moral cognition tends to be significantly overestimated, the prospects of moral progress face a formidable problem, the force of which has thus far been underappreciated.

This paper presents a methodology for assessing the socio-economic costs of road crashes as well as an estimate of the volume of these costs in Kazakhstan. Five costs components have been taken into account: medical costs, production loss, human costs, vehicle damage and administrative costs. A hybrid methodological approach has been used, which implies that three different types of methods have been applied to capture all costs: the human capital method (production loss), willingness to pay (human costs) and restitution costs method (other components). Input data were retrieved from existing databases from a variety of road safety stakeholders and other organizations. A household survey was conducted to collect additional information, including the willingness to pay for fatal crash risk reductions. Remaining data gaps have been bridged by using data from other countries. The socio-economic costs of road crashes in Kazakhstan are estimated at $6.8 billion in 2012, which corresponds to 3.3% of GDP. Human costs account for 81% of the total costs, vehicle damage for 11% and production loss for 6%. Administrative and medical costs are relatively very small cost components. More than half of the costs is related to injuries, while fatalities account for about a third of the total costs and property damage only accounts for approximately 10%. © 2021 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences",Costs; Human capital; Kazakhstan; Road accidents; Willingness to pay,Accident prevention; Cost estimating; Economic and social effects; Economics; Highway accidents; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Surveys; Administrative cost; Household surveys; Methodological approach; Middle-income countries; Property damage only; Road safety interventions; Road safety policies; Willingness to pay; Cost benefit analysis,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85109108093

While we want the benefits attached to AAs, it is essential that their behavior is aligned with our values and norms. Hence, an AA will need to estimate the values and norms of the humans it interacts with, which is not a straightforward task when solely observing an agent’s behavior. This paper analyses to what extent an AA is able to estimate the values and norms of a simulated human agent (SHA) based on its actions in the ultimatum game. We present two methods to reduce ambiguity in profiling the SHAs: one based on search space exploration and another based on counterfactual analysis. We found that both methods are able to increase the confidence in estimating human values and norms, but differ in their applicability, the latter being more efficient when the number of interactions with the agent is to be minimized. These insights are useful to improve the alignment of AAs with human values and norms. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Autonomous agents; Norms; Ultimatum game; Values,Autonomous agents; Philosophical aspects; Space research; Daily lives; Human agent; Human values; Paper analysis; Search spaces; Ultimatum game; Multi agent systems,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107492756

This literature review provides a systematic analysis of the experimental literature on the influence of situational factors on moral judgments in sacrificial dilemmas. It analyses 53 articles in detail and reports mean effect sizes, as well as operationalizations, for 36 situational factors that significantly influence moral judgment. Moreover, the review discusses how the impact of situational factors relates to a dual process theory of moral judgment.

However, past research did not investigate the effect on satisfaction with the government in the context of mobile government (m-government). The purpose of this paper is to evaluate how the social benefits of citizens using m-government affect their satisfaction with the government. Design/methodology/approach: Grounded in the uses and gratifications theory (UGT), the authors suggest that the satisfaction in m-government should be constructed in terms of the satisfaction with m-government and the satisfaction with the government. The research model of citizen satisfaction in the context of m-government is tested through partial least squares (PLS) (SmartPLS 2.0) based on data collected from a survey study in China. Findings: The results indicate that the three important social benefits, e.g. convenience, transparency and participation, are positively associated with process gratification, whereas only convenience is positively associated with content gratification. The results suggest that both process gratification and content gratification are positively associated with citizen satisfaction with the government. Furthermore, the research suggests that process and content gratification have a mediating role, whereas compatibility has a moderating role. Practical implications: This research provides insights to practitioners on how to facilitate citizen satisfaction by increasing citizens’ social benefits and improving process and content gratification. Originality/value: This study contributes to the literature by offering a framework for analyzing the impact of citizens’ use of m-government on their satisfaction with the government. The work also contributes to UGT by categorizing user gratifications into process gratifications, content gratifications and citizen satisfaction with the government. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Citizen satisfaction; Compatibility; E-government; Mobile government; Participation; Transparency; Uses and gratifications theory,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85106277276

The front-end phase is critical to project success, yet most studies have focused on lock-in in the implementation phase. Moreover, little is known about the way in which decision-makers perceive the risk of lock-in. In this paper we identify determinants of lock-in in the front-end phase and we reveal decision-makers’ perceptions of risk of lock-in. Our findings show that risk attitudes towards lock-in vary with the level of risk aversion. However, this is not sufficiently acute to drive the level of regret needed to avoid lock-in. This implies that decision-makers do not accurately assess the risk of lock-in and as such their risk perceptions are a mediating factor in the formation of lock-in. Based on escalation of commitment, path dependency, and prospect theory, the main contribution lies in providing a more comprehensive understanding of lock-in in the front-end phase. © 2021, The Author(s).",Decision-making; Escalation of commitment; Lock-in; Major transportation projects; Path dependency; Risk perception,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105909970

Many such initiatives are short-lived, however, and reasons for their success and failure under-researched. Using interviews, surveys, and documental data, we explored the survival rates, obstacles, and achievements of 49 initiatives in 10 Latin American countries. Contrary to those in other world regions, most initiatives have civil society stakeholders (notably universities, media, and businesses), excluding governments. Implementing citizen perception surveys proved effective to gain public attention. Several initiatives obtained name recognition and policy influence, which are significant achievements in megacities such as Bogotá, São Paulo, and Lima, where numerous NGOs vie for attention. Frequent obstacles include a lack of finances. After a seven-year period (2014–2021), 55% of the sampled initiatives remained active, ranging from 90% in Colombia to none in other countries. Organizational continuity appeared to be associated with network membership and discontinuity with diverging obstacles, including political pressures in some countries (e.g., Mexico), data scarcity in poorer ones (e.g., Bolivia), and a lack of sustained interest in relatively richer ones (e.g., Chile).

With higher speeds and less effort needed, the e-bike is a promising mode of transport to many, and it is considered a good alternative for certain car trips by policy-makers and planners. A major limitation of many studies that investigate such substitution effects of the e-bike, is their reliance on cross-sectional data which do not allow an assessment of within-person travel mode changes. As a consequence, there is currently no consensus about the e-bike’s potential to replace car trips. Furthermore, there has been little research focusing on heterogeneity among e-bike users. In this respect, it is likely that different groups exist that use the e-bike for different reasons (e.g. leisure vs commute travel), something which will also influence possible substitution patterns. This paper contributes to the literature in two ways: (1) it presents a statistical analysis to assess the extent to which e-bike trips are substituting trips by other travel modes based on longitudinal data; (2) it reveals different user groups among the e-bike population. A Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model is estimated using five waves of data from the Netherlands Mobility Panel. Furthermore, a Latent Class Analysis is performed using data from the Dutch national travel survey. Results show that, when using longitudinal data, the substitution effects between e-bike and the competing travel modes of car and public transport are not as significant as reported in earlier research. In general, e-bike trips only significantly reduce conventional bicycle trips in the Netherlands, which can be regarded an unwanted effect from a policy-viewpoint. For commuting, the e-bike also substitutes car trips. Furthermore, results show that there are five different user groups with their own distinct behaviour patterns and socio-demographic characteristics. They also show that groups that use the e-bike primarily for commuting or education are growing at a much higher rate than groups that mainly use the e-bike for leisure and shopping purposes. © 2021, The Author(s).",Dutch national travel survey (OViN); E-bike; Latent class analysis; Netherlands Mobility Panel (MPN); Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM); Substitution; Travel mode choice,Electric bikes; Leisure; Population statistics; Behaviour patterns; European Countries; Latent class analysis; Longitudinal data; National travel surveys; Socio-demographic characteristics; Substitution effect; Substitution patterns; Bicycles,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105603700

In this paper, we take a look at the role of AAC Tech in promoting an ‘empathic turn’ in the perception of non-speaking autistic persons. By the empathic turn we mean the turn towards a recognition of non-speaking autistic people as persons whose ways of engaging the world and expressing themselves are indicative of psychologically rich and intrinsically meaningful experiential lives. We first identify two ways in which AAC Tech contributes positively to this development. We then discuss how AAC Tech can simultaneously undermine genuine empathic communication between autistic persons and typically developed communicators (or neurotypicals). To mitigate this concern, we suggest the AAC field should incorporate philosophical insights from Design for Emotions and enactive embodied cognitive science into its R&D practices. To make our proposal concrete, we home in on stimming as an autistic form of bodily expressivity that can play an important role in empathic communicative exchanges between autistic persons and neurotypicals and that could be facilitated in AAC Tech designed for autistic people. © 2021 The Author(s).

The main research question of this paper is: What are the perceived advantages and limitations of energy models used by municipalities within their data-driven decision-making process concerning the natural-gas free heating transition? To answer this question, literature on energy models, data-driven policy design and modelling practices were reviewed, and based on this, nine propositions were formulated. The propositions were tested by reflecting on data from case studies of ten municipalities, including 21 experts interviews. Results show that all municipalities investigated, use or are planning to use modelling studies to develop planning documents of their own, and that more than half of the municipalities use modelling studies at some point in their local heating projects. Perceived advantages of using energy models were that the modelling process provides perspective for action, financial and socio-economic insights, transparency and legitimacy and means to start useful discussions. Perceived limitations include that models and modelling results were considered too abstract for analysis of local circumstances, not user-friendly and highly complex. All municipalities using modelling studies were found to hire external expertise, indicating that the knowledge and skill level that municipal officials have is insufficient to model independently. © 2021 Energies.

Its starting point is that processes of institutionalization invoke societal groups to articulate justice demands which, in their turn, give rise to processes of institutional redesign. In liberal democracies, demands for justice are articulated as a pursuit for emancipation and empowerment of groups that feel excluded by dominant categorizations. The imminent presence of this twin pursuit for justice can be explained by the conceptual inconsistencies that characterize the distinction between the public and private sphere. These inconsistencies also explain why demands for emancipation and empowerment are intrinsically ambiguous and inconsistent. In order to reconsider the question how institutions are to be adapted to allow for social justice while acknowledging the plurality, ambiguity and volatility of justice demands, the paper will propose an empirical and normative research agenda. © 2021 The Author(s).

Therefore, we need a better conceptualisation of manipulation that allows it to be overt and yet clearly distinct from related concepts of social influence.

Improving the performance of the last mile of delivery is considered key in meeting this challenge as it forms the most inefficient, expensive, and environmentally unfriendly part of delivery operations. A primary cause is a significant duplication of service areas, resulting in redundant vehicle kilometers traveled. In this paper, a new method is presented that allows for the allocation of parcels to delivery vehicles and construction of vehicle routes in real time through an auctioning system. These tasks are performed in a self-organizing manner by vehicles, parcels, and a supporting platform, to allow for collaborative and intermodal delivery. The performance of this new method is tested and compared against the currently used techniques using an agent-based simulation model.

Recent transformation efforts undertaken in government institutions have embraced business process re-engineering (BPR) concepts championed by the private sector over decades ago to facilitate such change. While public opinion continues to differ about these transformation efforts' success, there is little evidence to explain the influence of BPR on their success or failure. This paper explores BPR led public sector transformation efforts in two local authorities in Europe to evaluate the outcomes realised for both government and citizens. Empirical evidence reveals that while transformation efforts contributed towards improving efficiency and integrating processes across functions in the public sector, the institutional structures evolved into a collection of reshaped and newly formed siloes, which were distinctly focused on delivering a citizen-centric service. © 2021, The Author(s).",BPR; Business process re-engineering; Citizen centric; Public sector; Silos; Transformation,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103351410

To provide such information governments often choose to use standard appraisal methods being Cost-Benefit Analysis (CBA), Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) or Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Before we introduce various non-standard appraisal methods in this book volume, this chapter sets the stage by discussing the main characteristics of these three standard appraisal methods. CBA measures a project's societal value by transferring the project's societal effects into monetary terms using the notion of the amount of money individuals are willing to pay from their private income. These monetary impacts are aggregated into a final indicator such as the net present value (NPV). If the NPV is positive the project is considered to be welfare enhancing. MCA identifies criteria against which to test transport policy options. Next, the different criteria are weighted or scored to arrive at a ranking of options. An EIA is an evaluation of the likely effects of a project that significantly affect the environment. The most important difference between CBA and MCA is that the former method is based on welfare economics which provides strict procedures for the criteria/impacts that are considered in the analysis and for the weighting of project impacts, while in an MCA there is more freedom with respect to the selection of evaluation criteria and procedures to determine the weights. The most important difference between CBA and MCA on the one hand and EIA on the other hand is that EIA puts emphasis on a specific set of effects being the environmental impacts of a project. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",Cost-benefit analysis; Environmental impact assessment; Multi-criteria analysis; Standard transport appraisal; Transport assessment,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103318020

Recently the experimental city emerged, in which digital technologies give rise to ‘smart’ systems, but also to new forms of civic engagement.

Accordingly, while Just Intelligence Theory–comprising jus ad intelligentiam and jus in intelligentia–provides a useful starting point in the construction of a normative framework for national security intelligence activities, ultimately it is found to be wanting in a number of important respects. For instance, while war ought to be a last resort, intelligence collection and analysis ought to be a first resort. In addition, analyses are offered of the key principles of discrimination, necessity and proportionality, and it is shown in general terms how they apply, or ought to apply, to national security intelligence activity. Importantly, the principle of necessity has been given a novel analysis according to which it is in reality a set of different principles, depending on the institutional setting in which it is being used. Moreover, the analysis reveals that as typically used it consists (in part) of a means/end principle of rationality and one or other versions of a principle of harm minimisation. Finally, it is argued that there is a normative principle governing espionage, in particular, that is not a constitutive principle of Just War Theory; this is a principle of reciprocity. © 2021 The Author(s).

We hypothesize how technological change affects policy-making and identify conditions under which the streams can be (de-)coupled. We trace the formulation of the General Data Protection Regulation to show that the regulation occupied the legislative agenda when a policy window was exploited through policy entrepreneurship to frame technological change as a problem for data privacy and legislative harmonization within the European Union. Although constituencies interested in promoting internet technologies made every effort to stall the regulation, various actors, activities, and events helped the streams remain coupled, eventually leading to its adoption.

The original BWM assumes that decision-makers are always certain about their judgments even if, in reality, decision-makers often express uncertain preferences. To deal with uncertainty, we introduce a belief structure in the BWM, a concept involving the preference degree adopted via Dempster-Shafer theory. A new approach is proposed to allow BWM to cope with this kind of information, where the level of belief in preferences being expressed is taken into account. In addition, an inconsistency measurement and an uncertainty measurement are proposed for the belief-based BWM, providing the foundation for a reliability degree of the decision-makers, after which the belief-based BWM is extended to include a group of decision-makers. Based on their reliability degrees and the weights of the criteria obtained from the various individuals, the overall criteria weights can be aggregated accordingly.

This included local performance agreements for social housing policy obtaining a legal status. By introducing this policy instrument central government seeks to facilitate and ensure the tri-partite cooperation between municipalities, housing associations and tenants’ organisations in order to release funds by housing associations for social benefit. This should improve the position of municipalities and tenants’ organisations in social housing, and improve legitimate policy making. In this paper the main research question is: How are local performance agreements implemented targeting increased societal legitimacy in local social housing policy making, and what are its strengths and weaknesses in three selected cases in the Netherlands? A case study research design was used involving three local embedded case studies. As a theoretical framework the Contextual Interaction Theory was used. Data collection involved expert interviews and review of policy documents. Results reveal several weaknesses that impede the implementation of performance agreements, including issues in the broader governance regime and context, as well as issues with the inter-organisational structure and stakeholder interaction regarding the tri-partite cooperation between the key actors.

They connect customers to local energy sources without conversion, thus reducing power losses. However, the unique features of DC impose strict requirements for system operation compared to AC. Within the context of a liberalized energy market, this article demonstrates three promising market designs—an outcome of a comprehensive engineering design framework—that meet those DC requirements. They are an integrated market design, which incorporates all system costs into energy prices; a market design that passes wholesale energy prices directly to prosumers; and a locational energy market design that relieves congestion with nodal prices. An optimization model estimates the three market designs’ performance by simulating a realistic DC distribution system, featuring a high share of electric vehicles. Results indicate that the integrated market design is optimal in theory but computationally infeasible in practice. The wholesale energy price design aiming at constraint-free energy trading requires substantial investments in flexibility. The locational energy market design yields nearly optimal operation in urban networks and is considered the best feasible market design for DC distribution systems. © 2020 The Author(s)",Direct current; Distribution system; Electricity market design; Flexibility; Optimization,DC power transmission; Free energy; Investments; Location; Power markets; DC distribution system; Energy market designs; Engineering design; Liberalized energy markets; Locational pricing; Optimal operation; Optimization modeling; Substantial investments; Costs; electric vehicle; electricity industry; energy market; energy planning; feasibility study; optimization; price determination; price dynamics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093977411

The reasons for their success are, however, unknown. This paper proposes design recommendations to support designers of serious games for meaningful social interaction, based on player preferences, needs and desires, based on literature study and a case study for which a location-based game framework was designed, developed and evaluated. The case study with and for children/teenagers in Rotterdam focussed on the design of challenges by the children/teenagers for meaningful interaction with their environment, and the strengthening of their engagement with their own neighbourhood. The paper focuses specifically on: 1) if and when meaningful social interaction occurred during game play, how it occurred, and with which impact, and 2) the design choices/features that contributed to (the experience of) meaningful social interaction. On the basis of these results and the literature this paper proposes design recommendations to support designers of serious games for meaningful social interaction, taking not only the current players’ needs and desires into account but also those of future players. © 2020 The Author(s)",Meaningfulness; Serious games; Social interaction,Software design; Citizen engagements; Design recommendations; Game plays; Literature studies; Location based games; Neighbourhood; Rotterdam; Social interactions; Serious games,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092454586

While recent progress in the conceptualisation of frugal innovation as a phenomenon has been considerable, insights into the antecedents of frugal innovation remain relatively poor. We add to this literature by systematically conceptualising, theorising and empirically testing the relationship between resource constraints and the propensity of firms to produce frugal innovations, drawing on concepts of problemistic search and opportunity recognition. We distinguish two levels of resource constraints (firm-level and firm environment-level), and two types of frugal innovation (internally oriented and customer-oriented), while using managerial experience as a moderating internal factor. We find that firm-level resource constraints have a strong effect on the propensity of firms to engage in internally oriented frugal innovation, although only so for firms with experienced managers. This effect is lower when these firms operate in an environment that also faces high constraints. We find no effect of resource constraints on customer-oriented frugal innovations, but find a surprising negative moderating effect of managerial experience. We discuss the theoretical and policy implications of these findings for the frugal and wider innovation literature. This study is the first large-scale empirical investigation of frugal innovation that estimates its prevalence. We find that frugal innovation is quite common when using the widest definition of frugal innovation. The majority of frugal innovations are mundane internal efficiency upgrades through capital investment. © 2020 The Author(s).

Demand flexibility is a valuable resource that can be used to resolve these. Unfortunately, flexibility can also contribute to congestion, particularly when used to balance the grid. Using flexibility to solve grid problems without creating new ones requires well-designed financial incentives. Congestion management mechanisms (CMMs) are a primary example of such incentives. The question is which of these is most effective in preventing congestion with minimal impact on trading on the imbalance market. This question is answered by comparing traditional CMMs such as grid tariffs to a local flexibility market on their impact on the load in the grid and the lost value of flexibility on the imbalance market. This analysis shows that energy tariffs are not suited for preventing congestion. Capacity tariffs are able to prevent congestion but they impose limitations on the consumer which significantly reduce the value of flexibility on the imbalance market. The flexibility market, an example of a local market, is effective if aggregators do not have a position day ahead or if the distribution system operator limits the buying of flexibility a day before delivery. © 2020 The Author(s)",Congestion; Demand response; Energy flexibility; Flexibility market; Grid tariffs; Imbalance market,Energy policy; Congestion management; Demand response; Distribution systems; Financial incentives; Grid balancing; Grid problems; Intermittent energy source; Local flexibility; Commerce; comparative study; demand analysis; energy market; energy resource; market conditions; tariff structure,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092038363

Under uncertain and unpredictable circumstances, resilience becomes an essential property of a chemical process system that helps it better adapt to disruptions and restore from surprising damages. The resilience assessment needs to be enhanced to identify the accident's root causes on the level of technical-human-organizational interactions, and development of the specific resilience attributes to withstand or recover from the disruptions. The outcomes of resilience assessment are valuable to identify potential design or operational improvements to ensure complex process system functionality and safety. The current study integrates the Functional Resonance Analysis Method and dynamic Bayesian Network for quantitative resilience assessment. The method is demonstrated through a two-phase separator of an acid gas sweetening unit. Aspen Hysys simulator is applied to estimate the failure probabilities needed in the resilience assessment model. The study provides a useful tool for rigorous quantitative resilience analysis of complex process systems on the level of technical-human-organizational interactions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical process systems; Dynamic Bayesian network; FRAM; Resilience assessment,Bayesian networks; Chemical hazards; Complex networks; Assessment models; Chemical process systems; Complex Processes; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Failure Probability; Functional resonance; Operational improvements; Organizational interactions; Chemical analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090853659

In addition to some fixed countermeasures, previous studies have verified the feasibility of a patrol in addressing adversarial attacks. However, the previous patrolling practices fail to tackle the terrorist attacking problems in a large-scale area cost-effectively. To further tackle the protection issue with cost-beneficial solutions in a large-scale scenario, i.e., in a chemical cluster, we propose an area-partition-involved collaborative patrolling (APCP) game. We first leverage the proposed greedy deployment algorithm to determine the initial deployment of defenders (patrollers), including the quantity and position of patrol vehicles. Then, the large-scale area is partitioned into multiple smaller areas by using the collaborative idea of static partitioning. In the meantime, corresponding patrolling graphs are constructed based on graphic modeling methods. Finally, the APCP game is built between patrol vehicles (namely defender) and potential terrorists (namely attacker), in which patrol vehicles aim at detecting attack behaviors of terrorists by intelligently scheduling the patrolling routes. After formalizing the problem into a sequential game, we compute the Stackelberg equilibrium through the MultiLPs algorithm. Through case studies of three practical chemical cluster scenarios, the results explicitly show the superiority of our proposed APCP game by saving up to 25.48 % patrolling costs in a one-shot game compared to the results before partition. As for the collaborative patrolling problem in a large-scale area, the methods and models proposed in this paper can facilitate the management department of chemical clusters with intelligently scheduled patrolling routes, which can effectively reduce the cost of patrollers, and better protect the chemical cluster. © 2020 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Area partition; Collaborative patrolling game; Game theory,Terrorism; Chemical clusters; Deployment algorithms; Detecting attacks; Graphic modeling method; Initial deployments; Potential terrorist; Stackelberg equilibrium; Static partitioning; Military vehicles,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089438873

This paper aims at a conceptual understanding of the smart city by describing its various facets and using them to develop an Input-Output model helping policymakers and analysts make informed design choices. Using this model allows them to further their conceptual understanding of smart cities, envisage design choices they will face during planning and implementation, and help them to understand the impact of these choices.

Rapidly adapting to these changing circumstances and harnessing the potential of technological advances is the key to ensuring that power systems stay operational during disturbances, thereby improving resilience. This paper addresses this challenge by presenting an approach for improving resilience through local energy resource sharing across multiple distribution systems. The approach brings together the physical and the ICT layer of power systems through a self-organization approach that automatically alters the physical grid topology and forms local energy groups in order to mitigate the effects of widespread outages. Thereby, supply and demand are locally matched, and demand met is maximized during an outage. The results demonstrate that using the proposed approach, operational resilience of impacted distribution systems is improved. © 2019 The Author(s).

This includes the design of games, their validation, the actual game sessions, and applying the resulting knowledge from games in organisations.

AM creates objects by adding material layer by layer based on 3D models. At present, interest in AM is high as it is hoped that AM contributes to the competitiveness of Western manufacturing industries. Design/methodology/approach: A literature study is conducted to identify the factors that affect the selection of AM technology. Expert interviews and the best–worst method are used to prioritize these factors based on relative factor weights. Findings: Technology, demand, environment and supply-related factors are categorized and further mapped to offer a holistic picture of AM technology selection. According to expert assessments, market demand was ranked highest, although market demand is currently lacking. Research limitations/implications: The composition and size of the expert panel and the framing of some of the factors in light of previous literature cause validity limitations. Further research is encouraged to differentiate the selection factors for different AM implementation projects. Originality/value: The paper presents a more complete framework of factors for innovation selection in general and the selection of AM technology specifically. This framework can serve as a basis for future studies on technology selection in the (additive) manufacturing sector and beyond. In addition to AM-specific factor weights, the paper explains why specific factors are important, reducing uncertainty for managers that have to choose between alternative manufacturing technologies. © 2020, Vladimir C.M.

It shows that the energy sector relies heavily on risk assessment methods that are analytic, and that systemic methods provide important additional insights.Acase study of the Dutch gas sector illustrates this by comparing the hazard and operability study (HAZOP, analytic) with the system-theoretic process analysis (STPA, systemic). The contribution is twofold. This paper illustrates how system hazards will remain underestimated by sustained use of only analytic methods, and it highlights the need to study the organization of safety in energy transitions. We conclude that appropriate risk assessment for future energy systems involves both analytic and systemic risk assessments. © 2020 by the authors.

In particular, a bilevel programming model is established to minimize the total construction cost for the government in the upper level and maximize the shippers’ satisfaction in the lower level. The proposed model considers price, time, reliability, frequency, safety, flexibility, traceability, and emission. Two designs are obtained by applying the model to two scenarios, in which one is of the aggregate shipper group and the other is of the three distinct clusters. Results show that explicitly including heterogeneity in network optimization pays off in terms of the dramatic increase in shippers’ satisfaction and the share of the sustainable railway without generating extra cost for the system. The results of this study could lead to insightful implication for proper network planning for the China Railway express and some useful suggestions on the subsidies of the government. © 2020 by the authors.

Freight demand analysis is fundamental as a basis for the operational strategy of CRE and the investment policy along the CRE-routes. Most of the existing relevant literature has focused on the organization of the train operations of CRE, with little research related to demand analysis. This paper contributes to filling this gap by estimating customers’ demand preferences for rail freight service attributes, by using a novel multi-criteria decision-analysis (MCDA) method namely Best-Worst Method (BWM). To this end, a BWM survey was conducted in China to capture customers’ preferences for the main attributes that define the transport service offered by CRE. Two variants of BWM, the linear and the Bayesian, are employed for the analysis. Reliability is suggested as the most important attribute for CRE to focus on, to gain customers. We also conduct a cluster analysis based on the results, which helps the CRE operator to identify homogeneous customer segments, and to optimize the use of CRE's resources with a differentiated pricing strategy. © 2020",Best-Worst Method (BWM); China Railway Express (CRE); Cluster analysis; Freight demand preferences; Rail freight services,Cluster analysis; Economics; Investments; Railroads; Rails; Sales; Customer segments; Investment policies; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Operational strategies; Pricing strategy; Rail-freight services; Service attributes; Transport services; Railroad transportation; Bayesian analysis; cluster analysis; consumption behavior; demand analysis; freight transport; investment; multicriteria analysis; railway transport; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096644363

However, their deployment has moral implications, for example regarding data privacy, user autonomy, or distribution of responsibilities. ‘Energy justice’ is one of the most comprehensive frameworks to address these implications, but remains limited regarding smart grids, and regarding concrete guidelines for designers and policymakers. In this paper, we fill this gap by answering the following research question: How do design choices in smart grid projects impact energy justice? Thereby, four smart grid pilot projects are evaluated in a comparative qualitative case study research design. Data was collected through semi-structured interviews and a content analysis. Our findings contribute to the energy justice literature with insights regarding the design for distributive, recognition, and procedural justice. They underscore the importance of fairness in data governance, participatory design, user control and autonomy, technology inclusiveness, and the design for expansion and replication. Future research should explore the feasibility to govern smart grids as commons and the relationship between trust and perceptions of justice. We conclude with policy recommendations for funding future smart grid experiments and for facilitating the implementation of storage through electricity sector regulation. © 2020 The Authors",Case study research; Design for justice; Digitalization; Energy justice; Flexibility; Smart grid systems,Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Privacy by design; Electricity sector; Integration of renewable energies; Participatory design; Policy recommendations; Qualitative case studies; Research questions; Semi structured interviews; Urban energy systems; Smart power grids; comparative study; design; digitization; electricity supply; experiment; research; smart grid; social justice; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092889693

Although the current literature on SD has explored the relation between science and diplomacy, the question of how individual science projects can effectively aid SD has been left largely unanswered. Drawing on the SD as well as on the place and policy branding literature, a framework for the analysis and conceptualization of branding as a tool for SD and for Public Diplomacy in general is developed. This framework introduces three distinct branding styles: nation branding, policy branding and policy tool branding. The applicability of the framework is demonstrated by the comparison of two cases of branding by nation state policy makers: branding in the field of German transnational education and in the science and knowledge-based Dutch Water Diplomacy. The German case study shows that branding activities relating to ‘German’ SD are fragmented and focus mostly on individual projects, while the use of transnational education as an instrument to advance policy branding or nation branding remains largely underdeveloped. Such a lopsided branding process undermines the effectiveness of branding as an effective SD tool. In contrast, the potential of coordinated branding strategies as a foreign policy tool becomes apparent in the ‘Dutch Delta Approach’. In this centralised and coordinated branding process, activities on all three proposed branding layers were implemented, effectively employing branding to increase the visibility of the Dutch nation state, increase the attraction of its high-tech water management sector as well as to rejuvenate the Netherland’s bi-lateral relations with selected partner countries. Branding, as we argue, should be added to the analysis of contemporary science diplomacy as well as of broader foreign policies, adding to the understanding of SD as an instrument of cross-border communication and global opinion shaping. The paper ends with a discussion of potential limitations of branding, in order to illustrate that branding can be an effective instrument but should not be seen as an international relations panacea. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092766844

However, to support coordination in disaster response, disaster management information systems need to cater for the emerging roles, responsibilities and information needs of the actors, often referred to as self-organization. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a framework for disaster management information systems that embraces an actor-centered perspective to explicitly support coordination and self-organization. The framework is designed and validated to (i) analyze the current practice of disaster information management, including the way changes occur through self-organization, and (ii) study how to design disaster management information systems that support coordination and self-organization within the current practice. A case study in Jakarta is used to modify and validate the framework, and to illustrate its potential to capture self-organization in practice. The analysis showed that analyzing the actors’ activities through the framework can provide insights on the way self-organization occurs. Moreover, networking, preparedness and centralization were found to be key elements in the design of disaster management information systems with an actor-centered perspective. © 2020 The Authors",Community resilience; Coordination; Disaster response; Humanitarian operations; Information sharing,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092160190

By contrast, the demand side is usually underrepresented, often emphasising technological options for energy efficiency improvements. In this perspective, we argue that scientific support to climate action is not only about exploring capacity of “what”, in terms of policy and outcome, but also about assessing feasibility and desirability, in terms of “when”, “where” and especially for “whom”. Without the necessary behavioural and societal transformations, the world faces an inadequate response to the climate crisis challenge. This could result from poor uptake of low-carbon technologies, continued high-carbon intensive lifestyles, or economy-wide rebound effects. For this reason, we propose a framing for a holistic and transdisciplinary perspective on the role of human choices and behaviours in influencing the low-carbon transition, starting from the desires of individuals and communities, and analysing how these interact with the energy and economic landscape, leading to systemic change at the macro-level. In making a case for a political ecology agenda, we expand our scope, from comprehending the role of societal acceptance and uptake of end-use technologies, to co-developing knowledge with citizens from non-mainstream and marginalised communities, and to defining the modelling requirements to assess the decarbonisation potential of shifting lifestyle patterns in climate change and action. © 2020 The Author(s)",Behavioral change; Climate policy; Deliberative democracy; Integrated assessment modeling; Lifestyle; Transdisciplinary research,,Short Survey,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091262003

Researchers aim at developing fully autonomous systems that replace the role of human operators. Studies either focus on supporting conflict/collision detection (for manned ships) or solving conflict automatically (for unmanned ships). The cooperation between human and machine has been less focused on in existing studies. However, this type of cooperation is essential both in practice and in the future: firstly, demands on navigational assistance are still strong for supporting navigators in manned ships; secondly, MASS with different autonomy levels require increasing cooperation between human operators and machines, e.g. monitoring automation, remotely controlling the ship, etc.; thirdly, the intelligence of human and the machines is highly complementary. Moreover, fully autonomous ships cannot replace all the manual ships overnight. Therefore, the future waterborne transport system will be a system in which both human-operated vessels and autonomous vessels exist. In this article, we firstly provide an overview of existing modes of human-machine interaction (HMI) during ship collision avoidance. Then, we propose a framework of HMI oriented Collision Avoidance System (HMI-CAS) whose decision-making process is interpretable and interactive for human operators. The HMI-CAS facilitates automatic collision avoidance and enables the human operators to take over the control of the MASS safely. Moreover, the proposed framework acknowledges the under-actuated feature of ships. Simulations are carried out to demonstrate the proposed HMI-CAS.

While energy is vital for industries to thrive, various factors are undermining the availability of energy including phasing out of fossil fuels, CO2 emission caps and, the large gap between the fast developments of industrial clusters and the energy supply, especially in developing countries. Recently, enabled by renewable energy technologies, a transition process is taking place towards decentralized settings for energy provision where households in neighbourhoods initiate renewable electricity cooperatives. The question addressed in this research is if or to what extent the model of collective action deployed by citizen cooperatives is applicable to collaborations between industries in an industrial cluster. We identified the conditions for the establishment of Industrial Community Energy Systems (InCES) from a collective action perspective by using Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development Framework. The case study selected is the industrial city of Arak, one of the largest and most diversified industrial clusters in Iran. Besides desk research, data was also collected by conducting semi-structured interviews and by holding stakeholder workshops. The results of this study highlight the importance of community spirit and trust for the establishment of InCES, unlike citizen cooperatives where finance and environmental attitude are essential. A transparent legal framework to resolve conflicts that might emerge in industrial partnerships is another crucial element given the many differences among industries such as differences in energy demand and in usage patterns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Collective action; Common pool resources; Community energy systems; Industrial collaboration; Institutional analysis and development framework; Renewable energy transition,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090977250

Recent studies show that besides being inert and resistant to change, incumbents can also support transitions. We focus on the agency of a particular type of incumbent, grid operators. In several countries, these actors play an active role in institutional change in the energy domain. At the same time, they are engaging in activities to maintain the regime. This paper examines the actions of grid operators when performing institutional work, i.e. when creating, maintaining and disrupting institutions. We conducted a qualitative content analysis of Dutch media to analyze the actions of grid operators while engaging with decentralized energy innovations. We conclude that grid operators are both subject and object of institutional work as part of a distributed, collective process of institutional change. Furthermore, our analysis reflects on their paradoxical position as embedded actors engaging in institutional change. © 2020 The Authors",Decentralized energy innovations; Embedded agency; Energy transition; Grid operators; Incumbents; Institutional work,energy planning; innovation; maintenance; media role; operations technology; power plant; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090011983

Cities are usually hesitant to consider the effective, yet controversial idea of congestion pricing as a measure to abate the growing economic and environmental problems. In the longstanding search for an effective and acceptable pricing scheme, there has been an increased interest in tradable credits. Compared to charging instruments, this novel concept has the theoretical advantage that it can better address equity issues while effectively reducing congestion. Although one may argue that tradable peak credits (TPC) lead to higher public acceptability, very few empirical studies have researched this. Therefore, this study explores attitudes towards TPC using five focus groups with Dutch citizens. The participants were confronted with a hypothetical city where two instruments were suggested: peak charge (PC) and TPC. Most participants preferred PC and only two participants supported TPC while opposing PC. The advantages as addressed in literature played minor roles in the discussions. Participants revealed a sceptical attitude towards TPC or were more convinced about PC. Contrary to expectations, the attitudes became more negative as the discussions developed. Based on these insights, we propose directions for future research to assist the search for an acceptable congestion pricing instrument. © 2020 The Authors",Acceptability; Congestion charge; Focus groups; Personal permit trading; Road pricing,empirical analysis; perception; public attitude; road pricing; traffic congestion; traffic management; urban transport; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089814310

This, however, requires MANETs to be adaptable to dynamic contexts characterized by the changing density and mobility of devices and availability of energy sources. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a decentralized context-adaptive topology control protocol. The protocol consists of three algorithms and uses preferential attachment based on the energy availability of devices to form a loop-free scale-free adaptive topology for an ad-hoc communication network. The proposed protocol has a number of advantages. First, it is adaptive to the environment, hence applicable in scenarios where the number of participating mobile devices and their availability of energy resources is always changing. Second, it is energy-efficient through changes in the topology. This means it can be flexibly combined with different routing protocols. Third, the protocol requires no changes on the hardware level. This means it can be implemented on all current phones, without any recalls or investments in hardware changes. The evaluation of the protocol in a simulated environment confirms the feasibility of creating and maintaining a self-adaptive ad-hoc communication network, consisting of multitudes of mobile devices for reliable communication in a dynamic context. © 2020, The Author(s).",Context-adaptive; Energy efficiency; Mobile ad-hoc networks; Preferential attachment; Self-adaptive; Self-organized; Topology control and management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089739774

Is a community the people who make it up, or the geography or physical infrastructure they share? What about the resilience of communities that transform, as a result of a sudden disaster or over time? In this paper, we explore the impact of this tension on how social resilience indicators can be developed and used. Beginning with a close look at the ways in which our concepts of resilience and our use of indicators interact, several points are raised. First, that how we identify a community and frame its resilience conveys particular conceptualisations of resilience, which in turn have normative implications for the communities themselves. In part, this is because of the difficulty in capturing important adaptations and transformative actions within and by those communities. Further, measuring and comparing the resilience of communities, and aspects of quantification that go along with selecting, aggregating and comparing indicator values, ensure that the decisions made about how indicators ought to be used carry normative weight. Through this exploration, we identify several normative implications of choices in indicator design and application. We conclude with recommendations for moving forward with greater transparency and responsibility toward those communities whose social resilience we hope to measure in order to improve. © 2020 The Author(s)",Adaptation; Decision-making; Indicators; Normativity; Social resilience; Transformation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089531710

The Netherlands is the second largest exporter of vegetables in the world, and more than half of its land area is used for agriculture with some greenhouse complexes covering 175 acres. However, to retain this leading position, the sector has acknowledged that it needs to keep innovating. To further reduce waste and environmental impact, an innovative production strategy is being developed to support a circular economy: the circular greenhouse. LDE Greenport Hub is an entity of the strategic alliance of the universities of Leiden, Delft and Erasmus and is focused on horticulture scientific research and education in collaboration with major horticulture industry partners (such as sector association Glastuinbouw Nederland). It has initiated ‘Mission to Mars’, a program to boost innovation and development of the circular greenhouse by adopting concepts and technologies from space. Space is inherently focused on circularity because of scarce resources. A good example is the MELiSSA concept of the European Space Agency in which human waste is broken down into nutrients for crops and algae by a series of bioreactors. The crops and algae consequently provide food and oxygen for the crew again. The Mission to Mars program started with a lecture series in the beginning of 2018 at the World Horti Center, a horticulture business and innovation center in Naaldwijk. In seven lectures different aspects of sustainability and circularity were explored together with researchers, students, growers and horticulturists. The lectures covered (1) energy, (2) water, (3) lighting and climate, (4) soil, substrate and plant health, (5) material and energy streams, (6) digitization and automation, and (7) urban and vertical farming. It quickly became clear that not only terrestrial horticulture could benefit from space technologies, but that human space exploration could equally benefit from the technical and tacit knowledge of growers and horticulturists for food production in space. A list of potential research topics was identified. These topics are to be explored in a follow-up ESA Innovation Exchange, together with space technology partner ICE Cubes. The goal is to go beyond the circular greenhouse and demonstrate how space itself can be an environment for plant biology innovation, and hence increase future food security on Earth. © 2020 The Authors",Circular greenhouse; Horticulture; Innovation; Space biology; Space farming; Technology transfer,Agricultural robots; Algae; Biological water treatment; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental impact; Food supply; Greenhouses; Space flight; Space research; Sustainable development; European Space Agency; Human space explorations; Potential researches; Production strategy; Scientific researches; Space explorations; Strategic alliance; Technological advancement; Earth (planet),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089411997

Using the latest version of technology acceptance models (UTAUT2), this study examines the effect of Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, Social Influence, Price Value and Perceived Safety on acceptance and usage of a newly introduced bicycle sharing system in Mashhad (MBSS), Iran. The mediating effect of intention to use MBSS on the relationship between these constructs and use behaviour was examined. A total of 600 questionnaires were distributed at 128 MBSS stations of which 271 users responded. The result of a regression analysis indicated that intention to use MBSS was predicted by all the studied constructs except for Price Value, while a path analysis showed that through the Behavioural Intention, Facilitating Conditions was the only significant construct to influence Use Behaviour. Findings did not support age, income, education, and experience as moderating the relationships between the constructs and Behavioural Intention. This study recommends tracking the barriers of acceptance of bicycle sharing system by those population groups who do not use the system or use it less than the others. Moreover, findings of this study suggest improvements to Facilitating Conditions such as integration of public transport and MBSS, relocation of the stations to improve their (equity of) accessibility and, introducing motivational promotion campaigns, improving cycling social status, and improved customer service of staff may make MBSS more interesting for citizens. © 2020 World Conference on Transport Research Society",Bicycle sharing; Iran; Users' acceptance; UTAUT,accessibility; environmental factor; path analysis; perception; public transport; questionnaire survey; relocation; transport vehicle; transportation safety; transportation technology; travel behavior; Iran; Mashhad; Razavi Khorasan,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089292678

The CSFs are identified via a comprehensive literature review and are validated by experts' opinions. The validated CSFs are further analyzed using the best–worst method (BWM) and the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). The BWM is used to identify the weights of the CSFs, and DEMATEL is used to determine the cause–effect relationship between the CSFs. The findings show that “leadership and top management commitment” is the most important CSF. Six CSFs are classified as causal towards CE practices: “leadership and top management commitment,” “strong legislation towards CE practices,” “ecological scarcity of resources,” “knowledge of CE practices,” “funding support for R&D from the government,” and “competitor pressure on CE practices.” The findings of this study can help managers in the leather industry implement CE practices in their existing SCs to minimize waste. © 2020 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",business strategy; BWM; circular economy; critical success factors; DEMATEL; environmental protection; leather industry; resource optimization,business development; environmental fate; industrial development; strategic approach; supply chain management; textile industry,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088972982

Their ability to be agile and adaptive has been stressed, particularly in regard to the timing of policy measures, the level of decision centralization, the autonomy of decisions and the balance between change and stability. In this contribution we use our observations of responses to COVID-19 to reflect on agility and adaptive governance and provide tools to evaluate it after the dust has settled. Whereas agility relates mainly to the speed of response within given structures, adaptivity implies system-level changes throughout government. Existing institutional structures and tools can enable adaptivity and agility, which can be complimentary approaches. However, agility sometimes conflicts with adaptability. Our analysis points to the paradoxical nature of adaptive governance. Indeed, successful adaptive governance calls for both decision speed and sound analysis, for both centralized and decentralized decision-making, for both innovation and bureaucracy, and both science and politics. © 2020",Adaptive governance; Adaptivity; Agile governance; Agile organization; COVID-19; Pandemic; Response; SARS-CoV-2,Computer networks; Information management; Adaptive governance; Crisis response; Decentralized decision making; Institutional structure; Limited information; Policy measures; Sound analysis; Speed of response; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086838104

Industry 4.0 emerged as a phenomenon about a decade ago. That is why, it is interesting now to explore the implementation of the concept. In doing so, four research questions are addressed: (1) What is Industry 4.0? (2) How to implement Industry 4.0? (3) How to assess the implementation status of Industry 4.0? (4) What is the current implementation status of Industry 4.0? Design/methodology/approach: Subgroups of articles are formed, around one or more research questions involving the implementation of Industry 4.0. The articles are carefully analyzed to provide comprehensive answers. Findings: By comparing definitions systematically, the authors show important aspects for defining Industry 4.0. The articles in the special issue explore several cases of manufacturing companies that implemented Industry 4.0. In addition, systematic approaches to aid implementation are described: an approach to combine case-study results to solve new implementation problems, approaches to assess readiness or maturity of companies regarding Industry 4.0 and surveys showing the status of implementation in larger samples of companies as well as showing relationships between company characteristics and type of implementation. Small and large firms differ considerably in their process of implementing Industry 4.0, for example. Research limitations/implications: This special issue discusses implementation of Industry 4.0. The issue is limited to 11 articles, each of which with its own strengths and limitations. Practical implications: The practical relevance of the issue is that it focuses on the implementation of Industry 4.0. Cases showing successful implementation, measurement instruments to assess degree of implementation and advice how to build a database with cases together with large-scale studies on the state of implementation do provide a wealth of information with a large managerial relevance. Originality/value: The paper introduces an original take on Industry 4.0 by focusing on implementation. The special issue contains both literature reviews, articles describing case studies of implementation, articles developing systematic measurement instruments to assess degree of implementation and some articles reporting large-scale studies on the state of implementation of Industry 4.0 and thereby combine several perspectives on implementation of Industry 4.0. © 2020, Roland Ortt, Claire Stolwijk and Matthijs Punter.",Implementation; Industry 4.0; Maturity; Readiness; Smart industry; Smart manufacturing,Industrial management; Software engineering; Case-studies; Design/methodology/approach; Large-scale studies; Literature reviews; Manufacturing companies; Measurement instruments; Research questions; Wealth of information; Industry 4.0,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092285517

The combination of internal congestion in the meshed European network with a growing share of renewables increases the frequency and magnitude of congestion events and limits cross-border trade. The growing costs of redispatching and the divergence between grid physics and zonal markets lead to welfare losses. This paper is the first to propose an approach to improve the combined efficiency of flow-based market coupling and redispatching. We develop a novel methodology for congestion management in a zonal market with flow-based market coupling in order to increase cross-border exchanges by integrating preventive redispatch into the day-ahead market. In this approach, a set of integrated redispatch units is selected based on their high potential to reduce congestion and, as a result, free up grid capacity for cross-border exchange. We use three multi-step optimization models to demonstrate the benefits of the enhanced zonal market with integrated redispatch by comparing it to the nodal market model and a zonal market model with flow-based market coupling. The case study demonstrates the potential of the proposed methodology to significantly increase cross-border capacity and reduce the need for costly ex post redispatch. The approach is shown to be a feasible option for improving European market integration and thereby to achieve overall welfare gains. © 2020 The Authors",Congestion management; Cross-border exchange; Energy system optimization; Flow-based market coupling; Redispatch,Electric industry; Electric load dispatching; Congestion events; Congestion management; Cross-border capacities; Cross-border trades; Electricity market design; European networks; Novel methodology; Optimization models; Power markets; alternative energy; electricity; energy market; integrated approach; management practice; market conditions; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089484312

The aim of this study is to enhance the current modelling practices of human-flood interaction to draw new insights for flood risk management (FRM) policy design. The paper presents a coupled agent-based and flood model for the case of Hamburg, Germany, to explore how individual adaptation behaviour is influenced by flood event scenarios, economic incentives and shared and individual strategies. Simulation results show that a unique trajectory of adaptation measures and flood damages emerges from different flood event series. Another finding is that providing subsidies increases the number of coping households in the long run. Households' social network also has a strong influence on their coping behaviour. The paper also highlights the role of simple measures such as adapted furnishings, which do not incur any monetary cost, in reducing households' vulnerability and preventing millions of euros of contents damages. Generally, we demonstrate that coupled agent-based and flood models can potentially be used as decision support tools to examine the role of household adaptation measures in flood risk management. Although the findings of the paper are case-specific, the improved modelling approach shows the potential to be applied in testing policy levers and strategies considering heterogeneous individual behaviours. © 2020 Author(s).",,Behavioral research; Decision support systems; Flood control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Decision support tools; Economic incentive; Flood modelling; Flood risk management; Household level; Individual behaviour; Monetary costs; Testing policy; Floods; adaptive management; flood; flood control; flooding; hazard management; hydrological modeling; vulnerability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096227864

The purpose of this study is to apply the social life cycle assessment (S-LCA) tool and investigate the social performance of the Dutch energy transition while focusing on individual behavior, and if this is not possible, to develop indicators focusing on individual behavior dimension. The social performance of the energy transition in the Netherlands was assessed on a hotspot level. Additionally, the S-LCA guidelines were examined to identify the human dimension and behavior in the existing subcategories, and environmental psychology literature was explored to identify drivers and behavior that are important for the energy transition. Existing subcategories fail to show the extent of social progress of the Dutch energy transition nor how individuals perceive it. As a result, a total of 8 subcategories and 25 indicators at a hotspot and site-specific levels are developed. These subcategories and indicators focus on prosumer’s and individual’s behaviors, and traits of local communities. Application of the developed hotspot indicators shows that the Dutch government still subsidies fossil energy and, even though Dutch citizens show environmental concerns, the energy transition is delayed due to insufficient top-down coordination. Developed indicators are considered to be both feasible and relevant to investigate the social aspects of the energy transition in developed countries. © 2020 by the authors.

Its governance requires knowledge on how to steer the transition from the existing status quo to the target situation (transformation knowledge). The energy system is, however, a complex socio-technical system whose dynamics are influenced by behavioural and institutional aspects, which are badly represented by the dominant techno-economic scenario studies. In this paper, we therefore investigate and identify characteristics of model studies that make agent-based modelling supportive for the generation of transformation knowledge for the Energiewende. This is done by reflecting on the experiences gained from four different applications of agent-based models. In particular, we analyse whether the studies have improved our understanding of policies’ impacts on the energy system, whether the knowledge derived is useful for practitioners, how valid understanding derived by the studies is, and whether the insights can be used beyond the initial case-studies. We conclude that agent-based modelling has a high potential to generate transformation knowledge, but that the design of projects in which the models are developed and used is of major importance to reap this potential. Well-informed and goal-oriented stakeholder involvement and a strong collaboration between data collection and model development are crucial. © 2020 by the authors.

Designing and implementing integrated policy packages, with consideration for the interdependencies between measures and actors is a promising approach and thus an interesting research topic. A large part of the literature on transport policy looks at separate measures and their effects. These measures in reality always work in constellation with other measures and understanding their dependencies in a way to create synergies through packaging has been the topic of theoretical discussions. However, empirical research on policy packaging is sorely lacking. In this paper, we examine the implementation process of packaging of TM measures from the perspective of actors and their distinct roles and interactions. The data is collected by document analysis and interviews with officers in a Chinese city. Several major problems threatening the implementation of policy packaging are detected, including overlooking implementation at district-level, resource competition between measures, and the absence of integrative supervision. It provides a first answer to the discrepancy occurring in the promise of real-world crafting of well-integrated policies for sustainable mobility. © 2020 The Authors",China; Infrastructure planning; Integrated transport policy; Multi-level governance; Policy packaging; Transport demand management,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089247924

Two key themes guided the workshop discussion: the introduction of competition (processes of implementation and shifting competition regimes) and the functioning of mature competitive tendering regimes (contract design, bid evaluation and results). The workshop outcomes are presented along the line of three main issues. The first one is regime shifts, looking at triggers that make regimes evolve, discussing whether change necessarily takes place for the better and whether a regulatory cycle can be observed. The second one is getting a closer look at what exactly is being subjected to competition, discussing contractual scope, unbundling options, the function of the authority, system management and risk allocation. The third one investigates the actual functioning of competitive tendering regimes, discussing the issue of contract standardisation, bidding procedures and the design of evaluation and awarding mechanisms. The main recommendation of the workshop is to increase the strength of the PTA and to choose for gross-cost contracts. © 2020 The Authors",Competition; Competitive tendering; Contracting; Public transport institutions; Regulatory reforms,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088797048

During an indoor emergency, an efficient evacuation is required to help the users to move to the safe areas. Many types of incidents could impact the movements of users and this requires studying the behavior of the people during the evacuation. The reaction of the users to the incidents could affect the evacuation procedures and that could lead to several types of injuries or death. Each user understands and perceives the indoor environment differently and this plays a critical role in the evacuation. Furthermore, the users of the indoor environments have different rights to access the indoor spaces, which affects the movements of the users during an incident. This paper aims to support the evacuation of a building (educational building) in a crisis by using the integrated model of LADM-IndoorGML and the representation of the 3D model of the building. This research is presenting the initial assessment based on real world application. To reflect evacuation cases, we extended the conceptual model of LADM-IndoorGML to define the access rights for users of indoor environments during crisis. An evacuation exercise has been held at the Faculty of Applied Science at TU Delft to study the access rights during an incident. During the evacuation, Wi-Fi data has been collected for the users of the building for further analysis. A 3D model has been built for the Faculty of Applied Science to analyze the movement of the users. The collected data of the Wi-Fi access points have been structured and imported into the freeware database PostgreSQL/PostGIS. Furthermore, the geometry of 3D model was used to visualize the users’ movements as individuals and groups of users according to their connection to Wi-Fi access. Appropriate visualization has been created using QGIS. This paper demonstrates the entire process of analysis and visualization of users’ movements based on the Wi-Fi logs by using the extended LADM-IndoorGML. The outcome of the research has showed that the results for individual users and group users attached to the same access point differs.

With an empirical focus on Oslo and Amsterdam metropolitan areas, this paper analyses how the interplay between formal frameworks, informal institutions, and individuals’ agency can contribute to making public transport more attractive in relation to other modes. Findings indicate that formal frameworks, informal institutions, and key actors co-exist and interact in complementary, substitutive, and accommodating manner; they work alongside each other to facilitate collective decision-making on issues ranging from integrating land use and transport to dealing with budget constraints. By identifying these types of interaction, this study shows that, to advance transport sustainability, authorities not only need insight on what policies to design, but can also benefit from understanding how policy-making and implementation unfold. A broader insight offered by the paper is that financial performance goals appear as a main policy driver in public transport, eclipsing sustainability concerns. © 2020 The Author(s)",Agency; Governance; Informal institutions; Institutional analysis; Institutional entrepreneurship; Public transport,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080925419

In some parts of the grid, price volatility may be even more extreme due to congestion. Energy storage and price responsive demand provide a potential source of flexibility to reduce excessive variations in price. In this paper, we investigate the potential of one such type of price responsive demand, namely thermostatically controlled loads, to mitigate against this adverse economic effect through a coordination mechanism that gives explicit constraints on the local electricity price. In a simulation based study that focuses on an energy community situated in a congested part of the distribution grid, we investigate to what extent thermostatically controlled loads can provide load reduction in order to cap prices at a specified limit. Results show that congestion and the resulting price spikes can effectively be mitigated by exploiting the thermal inertia of the households. © 2020 IEEE.",,Electric power transmission networks; Heating; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Coordination mechanisms; Distribution grid; Electricity prices; Potential sources; Price responsive demand; Price volatility; Scale integration; Thermostatically controlled loads; Electric energy storage,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097352539

The study has several contributions. Firstly, it adds investment models into the review which have not been previously reviewed for decentralized energy modeling. Secondly, a modeling framework consisting of four building blocks is proposed that covers model conceptualization and model operationalization. Thirdly, the relationship between trading mechanisms and model methods is revealed using four evaluation criteria. Furthermore, by reviewing the papers, several trends in the literature are found. Operational models and local markets have been extensively studied, while wholesale market integration and investment models lack scientific attention. Among different trading mechanisms, the usage of bilateral contracts is most commonly seen. Lastly, optimization models significantly outnumber other model methods, and then it follows that their pitfalls such as the scalability of the model and the existence of stable outcomes need to be further addressed in future research. © 2020 IEEE.",Investment; Market design; Modeling; Operation; Prosumers; Review,Commerce; Electric power transmission networks; Smart power grids; Bilateral contracts; Decentralized energy; Evaluation criteria; Investment models; Operational model; Optimization models; Systematic Review; Wholesale markets; Investments,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097351825

With regard to sector integration, solutions need to be developed, especially for the mobility and the industry sector, because their ad hoc electrification and decarbonization seem to be unfeasible. Power-to-fuel (P2F) technologies may contribute to bridge the gap, as renewable energy can be transferred into hydrogen and hydrocarbon-based synthetic fuels. However, the renewable fuels production is far from economically competitive with conventional fuels. With a newly developed agent-based model, potential developments in the German energy markets were simulated for a horizon of 20 years from 2016 to 2035. The model was constructed through a participatory modeling process with relevant actors and stakeholders in the field. Model findings suggest that adjusted regulatory framework conditions (e.g., exemptions from electricity surtaxes, accurate prices for CO2-certificates, strong start-up subsidies, and drastic emission reduction quotas) are key factors for economically feasible P2F installations and will contribute to its large-scale integration into the German energy system. While plant capacities do not exceed 0.042 GW in a business-as-usual scenarios, the above-mentioned adjustments lead to plant capacities of at least 3.25 GW in 2035 with concurrent reduction in product prices. © 2020 by the authors.",Agent-based modeling; Energiewende; Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG) Umlage; European Union emission trading system (EU ETS); Germany's energy transition; Power-to-fuel; Power-to-gas; Power-to-liquid; Synthetic fuels,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Emission control; Hydrogen fuels; Simulation platform; Solar power generation; Taxation; Wind power; Concurrent reduction; Electricity generation; Emission reduction; Participatory modeling; Regulatory frameworks; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Transition process; Electric power system economics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093980789

The collision risk concerning obstacles is obtained using Time-Varying Collision Risk (TCR) concept, taking into account the velocity constraint of the ship that can achieve during operation. The influence of proximity from obstacles is measured with the Fast Marching (FM) algorithm. A new cost function is proposed allowing to combine the influence of obstacle proximity and collision risk in the region. Finally, the Fast Marching Square algorithm is applied to generate the globally optimal path that can reach the pre-set destination. The contribution of this work is two-fold: 1) considering the velocity constraint of the own ship, together with its influences of collision risk into the global path planning stage of autonomous navigation. 2) measuring the collision risk induced by the obstacles from their comprehensive influences on the achievable velocity range using TCR concept, instead of numerical integration of risk measurement.

Developing effective strategies to manage flood risk in coastal cities is often a costly and complicated process. In designing strategies, engineers rely on computationally demanding flood simulation models, but they can only compare a limited number of strategies due to computational constraints. This limits the efficacy of standard flood simulation models in the crucial conceptual phase of flood risk management. This paper presents the Flood Risk Reduction Evaluation and Screening (FLORES) model, which provides useful risk information in this early conceptual phase. FLORES rapidly performs numerous simulations and compares the impact of many storms, strategies, and future scenarios. This article presents FLORES and demonstrates its merits in a case study for Beira, Mozambique. Our results demonstrate that expansion of the drainage capacity and strengthening of its coastal protection in the southwest are crucial components of any effective flood risk management strategy for Beira. © Author(s) 2020.

Developing and emerging countries still lag far behind in the implementation of such policies when compared with developed countries. This exposure gap provides an opportunity for policy transfer, but this is a complex process requiring knowledge of many contextual factors and involving multiple steps. A good understanding of those contextual factors of measures by cities may be critical for a successful transfer. Our study aimed to identify the different contexts of urban logistics measures or policies worldwide and to assess their significance for policy transferability. In this study, urban logistics measures discussed in the literature were retrieved with a systematic literature review method and then the contexts were recorded, distinguishing between economic development levels and geographical regions. The analysis revealed that the economic level and geographical location of cities both have a strong association with the type of measure implemented. Barriers and drivers were identified by assessing policy transfer between developed and developing countries. Institutional and physical barriers appeared to be highly pertinent for a range of measures, while drivers or facilitators were identified from specific problems in developing countries and the respective measures in developed countries. Thus, the analysis of contextual factors can provide a first response to the key challenges and opportunities of sustainable urban logistics policies transfer to developing countries. © 2020 by the authors.

Serious games are an acknowledged tool for training, learning, and decision making, as well as for helping to introduce innovative concepts for complex systems. Technological innovations for the transport domain that can improve sustainability are usually heavily dependent on the collaboration among actors. A simulation gaming approach can help these actors in understanding the challenges involved, and in finding solutions in a playful, interactive way. Our research approach includes a thorough literature review on games for innovation and collaboration in transport networks, and the development of two dedicated simulation games addressing sustainability innovations for the Port of Rotterdam, the largest seaport in Europe and one of the largest in the world. The two innovation cases are truck platooning and multi-sided digital platforms for barge transportation, both improving the sustainability of hinterland transportation. The games serve as instruments to reveal interactions and tensions among actors, contribute to the interpretation of their behavior, and eventually help all parties to reach a better understanding on how innovation adoption can be fostered, using an innovation ecosystem perspective. We are convinced that serious gaming, by providing a better understanding of the innovation process, will help the implementation of sustainability innovations in complex systems. © 2020 by the authors.

In many developing countries, improving the quality of life and livelihood is a key challenge. While development is a central goal of delta planning in such countries, the effectiveness of planning is challenged by uncertain changes in climate and socio-economy. Bangladesh (one of the countries) is moving towards the adaptive delta management approach to deal with such uncertainties. Historical examples illustrate that Community Livelihood Adaptation (CLA) can critically influence the effectiveness of a policy strategy. Therefore, there is a clear need to explore CLA under uncertainty. For that purpose, this paper develops and applies a conceptual model-based approach combining the mental model and scenarios techniques. Our approach starts by using a participatory process to elicit mental models a farmers’ community uses when considering adaptation decisions; we capture these in the form of a cognitive map, and this map can serve as a conceptual model for analyzing livelihood adaptation decision-making in a future-oriented scenario analysis. To illustrate the approach, a case study of cropping decision-making of farmers community at a polder location under the saline condition in the southwest of Bangladesh has been elaborated. Results show that the approach is useful in structuring the cognitive and qualitative nature of complex decision-making process, and helps in understanding the dynamic interactions of farmers’ adaptation decisions with other actors, their environmental attributes, and market traits. It can help policymakers anticipate the adaptation direction of policy strategies. © 2019 The Author(s).

It is argued that each of the three perspectives contributes to the debate of AI but that the third has the strongest potential to uncover blind spots in the current debate. © 2020 Institute for Research in Social Communication, Slovak Academy of Sciences 2020.",artificial intelligence; co-evolution; philosophy; society; technological determinism; Technology; values,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094640863

Given the consequences for others, risky and aggressive driving has a clear moral component. Surprisingly, however, there has been little research on the relation between morality and risky and aggressive driving behavior. In this study we aim at addressing this gap. First, we present a conceptual analysis of the relationship between moral values and aggressive driving behavior. For this purpose, we extend Schwartz's integrated model of ethical decision making and apply it to the context of aggressive driving. This conceptual analysis shows that moral decision-making processes consist of several stages, like moral awareness, moral judgment and moral intent, each of which are influenced by individual and situational factors and all of which need to materialize before someone's generally endorsed moral value affects concrete behavior. This suggests that the moral value-aggressive driving relationship is rather indeterminate. This conceptual picture is confirmed by our empirical investigation, which tests to what extent respondents’ moral values, measured through the Moral Foundation Questionnaire, are predictive of respondents’ aggressive driving behavior, as measured through an aggressive driving behavior scale. Our results show few and rather weak empirical relationships between moral values and committed aggressive driving behaviors, as was expected in light of our conceptual analysis. We derive several policy implications from these results. © 2020 The Authors",Aggressive and risky driving; Aggressive driving behavior scale; Integrated model of ethical decision making; Moral foundations theory; Moral values,Decision making; Public policy; Aggressive driving behaviors; Conceptual analysis; Decision making process; Empirical investigation; Empirical relationships; Ethical decision making; Integrated modeling; Situational factors; Behavioral research,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090919491

Two analytical frameworks are used and synthesized: the Sectoral Systems Innovation Assessment framework (SSIAf) and the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT). The key components of the former are: shaping of expectations, actor network formation, institutions, learning process, and stimulating market demand. The SSIAf components are then assessed against the four quality criterions of the GAT framework, i.e. extent, coherence, flexibility, and intensity. The research design presented in this paper applies the analytical framework developed to case studies of two cities: Singapore and Delhi. Data collection involved participant observation and expert interviews. The results of the study reveal that the overall governance conditions in Singapore are fairly strong and highly supported by the government, unlike Delhi where governance quality was found to lack coherence and intensity, and can be considered only moderately supportive to green building innovations. The results also reveal the role of government actors in steering the energy transformation process in building sector. The analytical framework developed in this paper can be further elaborated, also as a potential policy tool to support cities in managing energy system innovations like energy infrastructures, smart grids or community energy storage in diverse and complex urban settings. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Energy transitions; Governance; Green buildings; Innovation,Buildings; Digital storage; Energy storage; Community energy; Energy infrastructures; Energy transformation; Innovation assessment; Low energy buildings; Participant observations; Quality criterion; Research designs; Smart power grids; assessment method; building; energy policy; energy storage; innovation; Delhi; India; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089753356

By integrating social-cognitive theories in our agent models, we bear evidence from social and psychological studies on our models for human decision-making. Social practice theory (SPT) provides a socio-cognitive theory that emphasizes three empirically and theoretically grounded aspects of behavior: habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Previous work has emphasized the importance of SPT for agents, has made abstract models of SPT, or used SPT to study energy systems. This article provides a set of requirements for integrating SPT in agent models and an evaluation of 11 current agent models with respect to these requirements. We find that current agent models do not fully capture habituality, sociality, or interconnectivity, nor is there a model that aims to integrate all three aspects. For example, current models do not support context-dependent habits, use a comprehensive set of collective concepts, and support hierarchies of activities. Our evaluation allows researchers to pick one of the current agent models depending on their needs regarding habituality, sociality, and interconnectivity. Furthermore, this article shows the usefulness of an agent model that integrates SPT and provides requirements that help modelers to achieve this model. © 2014 IEEE.",Agent-based modeling; cognition; social intelligence,Abstracting; Autonomous agents; Decision making; Simulation platform; Social aspects; Agent-based model; Context dependent; Evidence driven agent-based models; Human decision making; Interconnectivity; Social cognitive theory; Social practice theories; Socio-cognitive theories; Computational methods,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089288362

Here, we analyse results of 220 studies projecting climate impacts on energy systems globally and at the regional scale. Globally, a potential increase in cooling demand and decrease in heating demand can be anticipated, in contrast to slight decreases in hydropower and thermal energy capacity. Impacts at the regional scale are more mixed and relatively uncertain across regions, but strongest impacts are reported for South Asia and Latin America. Our assessment shows that climate impacts on energy systems at regional and global scales are uncertain due partly to the wide range of methods and non-harmonized datasets used.

Moreover, studying regulation and private security industry dynamics can enable a better alignment of regulation to its objectives, namely to control abusive and corrupt conduct of some private security companies and to improve the professionalism of the industry. Using novel data on the width and the restrictiveness of private security regulation and data on firm birth rate, firm death rate and firm survival rate, an instrumental variable approach is employed in a panel data random effect models, covering the period from 2013 to 2017. As regulation increases, we document a decrease in firm birth rate, firm death rate as well as firm survival rate of recent newcomers. Regarding firm birth rate and death rate, we document a gradually decreasing impact of older regulation. However, while additional regulation negatively affects survival rate, we find no impact of older regulation on company survival.

This paper begins by framing drones in healthcare as a social experiment where ethical guidelines are needed to protect those impacted while fully realizing the benefits the technology offers. Then we propose an ethical framework to facilitate the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones used in public healthcare. Given the healthcare context, we structure the framework according to the four bioethics principles: beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice, plus a fifth principle from artificial intelligence ethics: explicability. These principles are abstract which makes operationalization a challenge; therefore, we suggest an approach of translation according to a values hierarchy whereby the top-level ethical principles are translated into relevant human values within the domain. The resulting framework is an applied ethics tool that facilitates awareness of relevant ethical issues during the design, development, implementation, and assessment of drones in public healthcare. © 2020, The Author(s).",Applied ethics; Drones; Public healthcare; Robot ethics; Value-sensitive design (VSD); Values hierarchy,artificial intelligence; beneficence; health care delivery; human; personal autonomy; social justice; Artificial Intelligence; Beneficence; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Personal Autonomy; Social Justice,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086792326

In response, this article presents an in-depth case study of city branding processes in a medium-sized Chinese city. Roles, resources and interactions among the city's stakeholders are analysed during the brand creation and implementation stages in two different economic city branding projects. The stakeholder involvement mechanisms we identify confirm that city branding creation in China primarily follows political rather than business channels. Chinese local public authorities and more specifically key politicians, departments, and public enterprises are core stakeholders in branding creation. However, this leads to challenges in the branding implementation, since key public sector players tend to withdraw themselves when implementation begins, leaving previously uninvolved private (and public) players to implement the brands. The unsuccessful transformation contrasts with those observed in Chinese megacities, where involvement of powerful corporations and support from higher levels of government are both much higher. It appears that the imperative of broad stakeholder involvement to make city branding successful as we know it for Western cities may also apply in medium-sized Chinese cities. © 2020 The Authors",Brand creation and implementation; China; Economic city branding; Industrial transformation; Medium-sized city; Stakeholder involvement,governance approach; industrial development; participatory approach; private sector; public sector; stakeholder; urban development; urban economy; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086123637

When a decision-maker provides the pairwise comparisons in BWM, checking the acceptable inconsistency, to ensure the rationality of the assessments, is an important step. Although both the original and the extended versions of BWM have proposed several consistency measurements, there are some deficiencies, including: (i) the lack of a mechanism to provide immediate feedback to the decision-maker regarding the consistency of the pairwise comparisons being provided, (ii) the inability to consider the ordinal consistency into account, and (iii) the lack of consistency thresholds to determine the reliability of the results. To deal with these problems, this study starts by proposing a cardinal consistency measurement to provide immediate feedback, called the input-based consistency measurement, after which an ordinal consistency measurement is proposed to check the coherence of the order of the results (weights) against the order of the pairwise comparisons provided by the decision-maker. Finally, a method is proposed to balance cardinal consistency ratio under ordinal-consistent and ordinal-inconsistent conditions, to determine the thresholds for the proposed and the original consistency ratios. © 2019 The Authors",Best worst method; Consistency measurement; Consistency threshold,article,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077925465

The planned ‘ratcheting-up’ process, which aims to ensure that the NDCs comply with the overall goal of limiting global average temperature increase to well below 2 °C or even 1.5 °C, will most likely include some evaluation of ‘fairness’ of these reduction targets. In the literature, fairness has been discussed around equity principles, for which many different effort-sharing approaches have been proposed. In this research, we analysed how country-level emission targets and carbon budgets can be derived based on such criteria. We apply novel methods directly based on the global carbon budget, and, for comparison, more commonly used methods using GHG mitigation pathways. For both, we studied the following approaches: equal cumulative per capita emissions, contraction and convergence, grandfathering, greenhouse development rights and ability to pay. As the results critically depend on parameter settings, we used the wide authorship from a range of countries included in this paper to determine default settings and sensitivity analyses. Results show that effort-sharing approaches that (i) calculate required reduction targets in carbon budgets (relative to baseline budgets) and/or (ii) take into account historical emissions when determining carbon budgets can lead to (large) negative remaining carbon budgets for developed countries. This is the case for the equal cumulative per capita approach and especially the greenhouse development rights approach. Furthermore, for developed countries, all effort-sharing approaches except grandfathering lead to more stringent budgets than cost-optimal budgets, indicating that cost-optimal approaches do not lead to outcomes that can be regarded as fair according to most effort-sharing approaches. © 2019, The Author(s).",,Carbon; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Sensitivity analysis; Bottom up approach; Developed countries; Emission targets; Historical emissions; Optimal approaches; Parameter setting; Reduction targets; Temperature increase; Budget control; bottom-up approach; carbon budget; cost analysis; emission control; equity; greenhouse gas; international agreement; mitigation; parameterization; research work,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061639180

The imbalanced distribution of passenger flow result in a hierarchical structure of PTN and it is also related to the development of technology and the introduction of new modes. However, there is still a lack of knowledge on how to identify the hierarchical structure of the multi-layer PTN. This study proposes a three-step passenger transfer flow based methodology for separating and ranking the PTN: (1) using passenger journey data to derive transfer flow matrix; (2) applying network representation with Louvain method of community detection to separate the PTN layers; (3) performing ranking method, separating inner-transfer and inter-transfer flow. To demonstrate our method, we use one-month smart card data of The Hague, the Netherlands provided by the PTN operator HTM. Our results show that our method is able to, regardless of the geographic location and the mode of transportation, identify the hierarchy of PTN based on the passenger transfer flow pattern. Temporal attributes are also discussed to illustrate how hierarchy is time-dependent, e.g. with respect to the day of the week and the time of the day. Our method supports public transport (PT) operators during design and optimization of PTN and in determining which sets of higher-level service to prioritize during different time periods. © 2020 IEEE.",community detection; data-driven; hierarchy; public transport network,Flow patterns; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Smart cards; Community detection; Design and optimization; Geographic location; Hierarchical structures; Network representation; Passenger journey; Public transport networks; Temporal attributes; Transfer matrix method,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098240484

However, the existing representation of the traffic state usually only considers the road congestion layer and divides the traffic state into congested and unblocked. Representation only at the congestion layer is difficult to reflect the road traffic state comprehensively. Therefore, we select three indicators from the layers of road congestion, road safety, and road stability, respectively, then utilizing K-means to cluster the traffic state. The clustering results can be regarded as a new type for the representation of a traffic state. As a result, the traffic states are divided into four classes, which comprehensively reflects the level of road congestion, safety, and stability. Using the four traffic states obtained from the clustering results as class labels, we applied a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) to classify the different traffic states, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve is assessed to verify the superiority of the classification results. Finally, a visual display of the real-time traffic state in a city’s central area was given. © 2020 by the authors.

These scenarios enable the determination of the robustness of a system—the consideration of performance across a range of plausible futures—and allow an assessment of which possible future system configurations result in a greater level of robustness. There are many approaches to selecting scenarios, and previous studies have observed that the choice of scenarios might affect the estimated robustness of the system. However, these observations have been anecdotal and qualitative. This paper develops a systematic, quantitative methodology for exploring the influence of scenario selection on the robustness and the ranking of decision alternatives. The methodology is illustrated on the Lake Problem. The quantitative results obtained confirm the qualitative observations of previous works, showing that the selection of scenarios is important, as it has a large influence on the robustness value calculated for each decision alternative. However, we show that it has a relatively small influence on how those decision alternatives are ranked. This implies that despite the difference in robustness values, similar decision outcomes will be reached in this case study, regardless of the basis on which the scenarios are obtained. It is also revealed that the impact of the scenarios on the robustness values is due to complex interactions with the system model and robustness metrics. ©2020. American Geophysical Union.

Although previous research gives insight into researchers' drivers and inhibitors for sharing and using open research data, both these drivers and inhibitors have not yet been integrated via a thematic analysis and a theoretical argument is lacking. This study's purpose is to systematically review the literature on individual researchers' drivers and inhibitors for sharing and using open research data. This study systematically analyzed 32 open data studies (published between 2004 and 2019 inclusively) and elicited drivers plus inhibitors for both open research data sharing and use in eleven categories total that are: 'the researcher's background', 'requirements and formal obligations', 'personal drivers and intrinsic motivations', 'facilitating conditions', 'trust', 'expected performance', 'social influence and affiliation', 'effort', 'the researcher's experience and skills', 'legislation and regulation', and 'data characteristics.' This study extensively discusses these categories, along with argues how such categories and factors are connected using a thematic analysis. Also, this study discusses several opportunities for altogether applying, extending, using, and testing theories in open research data studies. With such discussions, an overview of identified categories and factors can be further applied to examine both researchers' drivers and inhibitors in different research disciplines, such as those with low rates of data sharing and use versus disciplines with high rates of data sharing plus use. What's more, this study serves as a first vital step towards developing effective incentives for both open data sharing and use behavior. © 2020 Zuiderwijk et al.

Using a discrete choice experiment, we invited participants to make a series of choices between policy scenarios aimed at relaxing the lockdown, which were specified not in terms of their nature (e.g. whether or not to allow schools to re-open) but in terms of their effects along seven dimensions. These included health-related effects, but also impacts on the economy, education, and personal income. From the observed choices, we were able to infer the implicit trade-offs made by the Dutch between these policy effects. For example, we find that the average citizen, in order to avoid one fatality directly or indirectly related to COVID-19, is willing to accept a lasting lag in the educational performance of 18 children, or a lasting (>3 years) and substantial (>15%) reduction in net income of 77 households. We explore heterogeneity across individuals in terms of these trade-offs by means of latent class analysis. Our results suggest that most citizens are willing to trade-off health-related and other effects of the lockdown, implying a consequentialist ethical perspective. Somewhat surprisingly, we find that the elderly, known to be at relatively high risk of being affected by the virus, are relatively reluctant to sacrifice economic pain and educational disadvantages for the younger generation, to avoid fatalities. We also identify a so-called taboo trade-off aversion amongst a substantial share of our sample, being an aversion to accept morally problematic policies that simultaneously imply higher fatality numbers and lower taxes. We explain various ways in which our results can be of value to policy makers in the context of the COVID-19 and future pandemics. Copyright: © 2020 Chorus et al.

We support our arguments with two carefully selected, iconic examples from the Netherlands and indicate how the stretching ideals of ecosystem-based engineering could engender further shifts towards sustainability. © 2020 by the authors.",Building with Nature; Coastal and river engineering; Critical reflection; Ecosystem-based design; Impacts on nature and society; Infrastructure lifecycle; Multi-actor systems; Multifunctional flood defense; Nature-based solutions,Ecosystems; Hydraulics; Shore protection; Sustainable development; Ecological knowledge; Ecosystem functioning; Fundamental changes; Hydraulic engineering; Netherlands; Research programs; Hydraulic structures; coastal engineering; dike; ecosystem engineering; hydraulic property; metamorphosis; sustainability; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090909124

In this mixed environment, accidents between trams and VRUs are very rare but severe at the same time. Previous studies have acknowledged that tram driving is a complex and very demanding task. Yet, subjective notions of traffic safety that are more connected with the behavior of tram drivers, have never been quantified. This is important in order to better interpret the challenges that tram drivers face. To do so, a stated preference experiment was designed in which tram drivers in Athens rated their perceived safety and driving stress of different driving scenarios on a 7-point Likert Scale. The driving scenarios were presented to the tram drivers using static images. According to the estimated perceived safety model, the alignment type (such as exclusive, semi-exclusive), the existence and the type of pedestrian crossing and the volume of VRUs influence tram drivers' perceived safety. Driving stress was affected mainly by arrival delay and load of standing passengers. Route familiarity also appeared as an important factor, that influences driving stress. No statistically significant correlation between perceived safety and driving stress was observed. One explanation for this is that experienced tram drivers believe that they are ready to respond properly in a section that they perceive as unsafe, if they are familiar with it. If there is no familiarity, tram drivers lack confidence and therefore driving stress is increased. © 2020 The Author(s)",Driving stress; Perceived safety; Stated preference; Tram driving,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090015562

Process modelling and life cycle assessment were used to estimate CO2 balances for 45 cases. Without bioenergy or CCS, the estimated life cycle CO2 emissions for steelmaking were 1.3–2.4 t CO2/t steel. In our model, aggressive BECCS deployment decreased net CO2 to the order of −0.5 t to 0.1 t CO2/t steel. CCS showed a larger mitigation potential than bioenergy, but combined deployment was most effective. As BECCS use increased, CO2 from background supply chains became more relevant. In the high BECCS cases, if decarbonized electricity is assumed, net CO2 estimates decreased by 400−600 kg CO2/t steel. Conversely, at 700 g CO2/kWh, all cases appeared to be net CO2-positive. Accounting for the “carbon debt” of biomass, beyond biomass supply chain emissions, increased net CO2 estimates by approximately 300 kg CO2eq/t steel. We conclude that CO2-negative steel is possible, but will require significant interventions throughout the production chain, including sustainable biomass cultivation; efficient steel production; CO2 capture throughout steel and bioenergy production; permanent storage of captured CO2; and rigorous monitoring. © 2020 The Authors",Bioenergy; Carbon capture and storage; Carbon dioxide; Life cycle assessment; Negative emissions; Steel industry,Biomass; Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Life cycle; Steelmaking; Supply chains; Bioenergy productions; Biomass supply chain; CO2 emissions; Direct Reduction; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Process modelling; Production chain; Steel production; Carbon capture; biofuel; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; life cycle analysis; smelting,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088376304

Many CCS technologies are relatively novel, with only few large-scale projects constructed and in operation to date. Therefore, uncertainties in technology performance and costs are often substantial, making it imperative that they be characterized and reported. Although uncertainty analysis itself is not novel, with some methods already frequently used by the CCS TEA community, a document that provides a comprehensive overview of methods and approaches, as well as guidance on their selection and use, is still lacking. Given its importance, we seek to fill this gap by providing a critical review of uncertainty analysis methods along with guidance on the selection and use of these methods for CCS TEAs, highlighting good practice and examples from the CCS literature. The paper starts by identifying the different audiences for CCS TEAs, the different modelling approaches available for CCS technology performance and cost analysis, and the different roles that uncertainty analysis may play. It then continues to discuss established, as well as emerging, uncertainty analysis methods and addresses how and when each method is best used, as well as common pitfalls. We argue that the most commonly used method of one-parameter-at-a-time ‘local’ sensitivity analysis may often be a suboptimal choice, and that other approaches may be more suitable or lead to more insight, especially since uncertainty analysis software is becoming more widespread and easier to use. Finally, the paper discusses the benefits of advanced uses of uncertainty analysis in, for instance, the design of CCS experiments or in the design and planning of CCS infrastructure. Sound uncertainty analysis has an important role to play in TEAs of CCS technologies and systems, and there are many opportunities to bring the use of uncertainty analysis to a higher level than currently practiced. This review of and guidance on available methods is intended to help accelerate continued methods development and their application to more robust and meaningful CCS performance and costing studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",CCS; Design under uncertainty; Monte carlo simulation; Pedigree analysis; Pseudo-statistical approach; Sensitivity analysis; Sequential design of experiments; Uncertainty analysis software; Uncertainty quantification,Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Tea; CCS technologies; Design and planning; Large-scale projects; Sub-optimal choices; Techno-Economic analysis; Techno-economic assessment; Technologies and systems; Technology performance; Uncertainty analysis; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; economic analysis; guideline; performance assessment; uncertainty analysis; waste technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088360442

There is different level of maturity with automation in different transport modes (road, aviation, maritime and rail), however no systematic research has been conducted on the lessons learned in different sectors, so that they can be exploited for the design of safer automated systems. The aim of this paper is to review the impact of key human factors on the safety of automated transport systems, with focus on relevant experiences from different transport sectors. A systematic literature review is carried out on the following topics: the level of trust in automation – in particular the impact of mis-aligned trust, i.e. mistrust vs overreliance, the resulting impact on operator situation awareness (SA), the implications for takeover control from machine to human, and the role of experience and training on using automated transport systems. The results revealed several areas where experiences from the aviation and road domain can be transferable to other sectors. Experiences from maritime and rail transport, although limited, tend to confirm the general patterns. Remarkably, in the road sector where higher levels of automation are only recently introduced, there are clearer and more quantitative approaches to human factors, while other sectors focus only on mental modes. Other sectors could use similar approaches to define their own context-specific metrics. The paper makes a synthesis of key messages on automation safety in different transport sectors, and presents an assessment of their transferability. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Aviation; Human factors; Maritime; Rail; Road; Safety; Transport automation,"Human engineering; Personnel training; Roads and streets; User experience; Automated systems; Automated transport systems; Levels of automation; Quantitative approach; Situation awareness; Systematic literature review; Systematic research; Transport sectors; Automation; accident; automation; aviation; awareness; car driving; human; man machine interaction; mental function; prevention and control; procedures; psychomotor performance; reaction time; safety; traffic accident; traffic and transport; trust; Accidents; Accidents, Traffic; Automation; Automobile Driving; Aviation; Awareness; Humans; Man-Machine Systems; Mental Processes; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time; Safety; Transportation; Trust",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087340285

We define normative uncertainties as situations where there are different partially morally defensible -- but incompatible -- options or courses of action, or ones in which there is no fully morally defensible option. We conceptualize normative uncertainties, distinguishing between the four categories of evolutionary, theoretical, conceptual, and epistemic normative uncertainties. We will show different instances of normative uncertainties in climate adaptation strategies. We finally present two methods for identifying and dealing with normative uncertainties, namely, the Wide Reflective Equilibrium and adaptive planning. Situations of normative uncertainties have always been and will continue to be present in risk decisions and they have often been dealt with in an implicit manner.

Such frameworks are seldom informative about the geographical distribution of risk, raising questions on the fairness of the proposed policies. In the present work, we propose a new decision criterion that accounts for the distribution of risk reduction and apply it to support flood risk management decisions on a transboundary stretch of the Rhine River. Three types of interventions are considered: embankment heightening, making Room for the River, and changing the discharge distribution of the river branches. The analysis involves solving a flood risk management problem according to four alternative formulations, based on different ethical principles. Formulations based on cost optimization lead to very poor performances in some areas for the sake of reducing the overall aggregated costs. Formulations that also include equity criteria have different results depending on how these are defined. When risk reduction is distributed equally, very poor economic performance is achieved. When risk is distributed equally, results are in line with formulations based on cost optimization, while a fairer risk distribution is achieved. Risk reduction measures also differ, with the cost optimization approach strongly favoring the leverage of changing the discharge distribution and the alternative formulations spending more on embankment heightening and Room for the River, to rebalance inequalities in risk levels. The proposed method advances risk-based decision-making by allowing to consider risk distribution aspects and their impacts on the choice of risk reduction measures. © 2020 The Authors.

Crash count is a measure of the likelihood of occurring a potential harmful event, whereas crash severity is a measure of the societal impact and harm to the society. As the majority of safety improvement programs are focused on preventing fatal and serious injury crashes, identification of high-risk sites—or blackspots—should ideally account for both severity and frequency of crashes. Past research efforts to incorporate crash severity into the identification of high-risk sites include multivariate crash count models, equivalent property damage only models and two-stage mixed models. These models, however, often require suitable distributional assumptions for computational efficiency, neglect the ordinal nature of crash severity, and are inadequate for capturing unobserved heterogeneity arising from possible correlations between crash counts of different severity levels. These limitations can ultimately lead to inefficient allocation of resources and misidentification of sites with high risk of fatal and serious injury crashes. Moreover, the implication of these models in blackspot identification is an important, unanswered question. While a joint econometric model of crash count and crash severity has the flexibility to account for the limitations mentioned previously, its ability to identify high-risk sites also needs to be examined. This study aims to fill this research gap by employing the joint model for blackspot identification. Using data from state-controlled roads in Queensland, Australia, a new risk score is developed based on predicted crash counts by severity, weighted by the cost ratio of severity levels. This weighted risk score is then used for identifying road segments with high risk of fatal and injury crashes. Results show that the joint model of crash count and crash severity has substantially improved prediction accuracy compared to the traditional count models. The correlation between crash counts of different severity levels captures the unobserved heterogeneity caused by the extra-variation in total crash counts and moderates the parameters in the joint model. In comparison with the traditional approaches, the proposed weighted risk score approach with the joint model of crash count and crash severity leads to the identification of a higher number of fatal and serious injury crashes in the top ranked sites flagged for safety improvements. © 2020 The Authors",Blackspot identification; Crash frequency; Crash severity; Fatal and serious injury crash; Grouped random parameters; Hotspot identification; Ordered logit fractional split,"Computational efficiency; Damage detection; Risk management; Roads and streets; Traffic control; Econometric model; Prediction accuracy; Property damage only; Research efforts; Safety improvement; Traditional approaches; Transport networks; Unobserved heterogeneity; Highway accidents; epidemiology; human; injury; mortality; Queensland; risk assessment; statistical model; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Built Environment; Humans; Logistic Models; Queensland; Risk Assessment; Wounds and Injuries",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086080633

However, studies do not sufficiently address whether and how business model tools support the early, exploratory phase in which new business models are initiated, conceptualized, assessed and planned. In this exploratory phase, offerings and addressable markets are highly uncertain, which requires extensive idea generation, reframing, comparison and evaluation. This paper examines whether and how business model tools facilitate the process of business model exploration. Through action research, we find three ways in which business model tools can better facilitate the process of exploring, reframing and comparing alternative business models.

Our results point to a very specific group of ambidextrous scholars that is comparatively small. The scholars in this group are able to successfully balance research and application. In contrast, all scholars focusing on either pure basic or pure applied research face a trade-off between publications and innovations. In general, our findings suggest that the output productivity of all scholars is the higher the better their research orientation fits with their network activities.

The present study investigates how labour productivity has developed across Dutch medical specialists (2007-2017) and discusses its implications for workforce planning, also in relation to the existing literature. Methods: A regression model is developed in which the number of full-time equivalents is related to production (admissions), hospital characteristics and a trend parameter. The trend parameter captures the average annual change in the number of full-time equivalents per production output and is a measure for labour productivity. The model is applied to a micro-data set of Dutch hospitals in the period 2007-2017 across 24 different specialties using regression methods. Results: The results indicate an increase in the number of full-time equivalents per admission has increased for most specialisms and that labour productivity has thus decreased. However, there is considerable heterogeneity and uncertainty across different specialisms. Conclusions: The results amplify the issue of medical personnel shortages driven by the growing demand for health care. The research outcomes are linked to the existing literature regarding physicians' productivity. Changes in accountability such as using relative value units, incentive payments, use of staff and mid-level providers, and technology have been discussed, and some consensus has been reached. © 2020 The Author(s).",Labour demand; Medical specialists; Productivity; Technological developments,advanced practice provider; article; consensus; hospital care; human; medical specialist; productivity; specialization; uncertainty; workforce,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089770013

We call this collaborative approach, co-procurement. A mathematical model is formulated for the decision of procurement from multiple suppliers. The model is solved for individual buyers. The outcome shows the optimal number of items a buyer should buy from different suppliers such that the total cost is minimised for that buyer. Next, it is investigated how a group of buyers could make this decision together. The proposed model takes into account transaction costs of collaboration, to determine the optimal size of the collaboration and the involved parties. The idea is new in the old direction of procurement and it introduces the concept of transaction costs in this area and analyses its impact on the optimal collaboration size and mix. A case study from Dutch Food Valley is provided to investigate the benefits of co-procurement and validate the developed structure. The results indicate that co-procurement can bring considerable cost-savings through consolidation of orders and more efficient transportation schedules.

The Persian Gulf Mining and Metal Industries Special Economic Zone in Iran is used as a case study. The case study revealed that previous successful collaborations in the cluster were often self-organized, but stakeholders preferred to initiate new IS collaborations if financial incentives and infrastructure are provided. Meanwhile, the institutional analysis showed that institutional arrangements (e.g., pricing and penalties) are not in favor of IS emergence. Even though stakeholders might engage in self-organized IS because of inherent problems such as resource scarcity, the lack of clear and effective institutions could hinder IS. This understanding can help both the government and stakeholders in their strategies for future collaborations under different economic and environmental policies. © 2020 by the authors.",Drivers; Dynamics; Industrial symbiosis; Institutions,energy planning; Exclusive Economic Zone; infrastructure planning; metal; mining industry; participatory approach; planning legislation; social development; stakeholder; state role; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Iran; Persian Gulf,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089373678

Here we propose a multi-actor multi-objective regional energy system planning approach to help actors gain mutual understanding regarding each other's optimal investment wishes, in order to advance the planning process. This approach combines two models: Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) and Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). The approach uses illustrative objectives and actors which is then applied to the greater Amsterdam region to showcase its usage and strength. The four chosen objectives, i.e. total Capital Expenditure, total Operation & Maintenance costs, land-use and visually impacted area are minimized simultaneously to obtain a set of Pareto-optimal solutions. These solutions are then evaluated for governments, funders and local residents with different preferences using TOPSIS. The case study shows that our approach is unique and useful when multiple actors have to decide together upon the energy investment capacities.

To compare the three groups in mean performance and in frequency of scores exceeding 1.5 SD from the mean. Methods/Design: Participants were 37 drivers with MCI, 16 drivers with AD, and 21 control drivers over the age of 52. Driving measures were derived from four rural driving conditions: moderate traffic without and with distraction and high traffic without and with distraction. The measures were z-transformed based on the performance of 90 control drivers of different ages. Two unexpected incidents occurred per condition, requiring the sudden breaking to avoid an accident. Results: Drivers with AD showed significantly lower average speed, speed variability, greater headway distance, headway variability and average reaction time (RT) than control drivers. Drivers with MCI showed significantly lower average speed, greater headway distance and average RT than control drivers in the two conditions of distraction. No differences were found in accident probability. Drivers with AD had more deviant scores than both control drivers and drivers with MCI in most comparisons. Predictors of accident probability were average RT, speed variability and lateral position variability but MCI and AD status were not significant predictors in any of the regression models. Conclusions: Despite significant differences in performance, drivers with MCI and AD did not differ in accident probability from control drivers. An individualized approach of examining individual driving performance is recommended. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",accidents; Alzheimer's disease; driving simulator; mild cognitive impairment,accident; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; Article; car driving; controlled study; dementia; driving ability; human; major clinical study; mild cognitive impairment; probability; reaction time; risk assessment; risk factor; simulation; velocity; accident; cognitive defect; Accidents; Alzheimer Disease; Cognitive Dysfunction; Humans; Reaction Time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083574527

Although a lot of attempts have been done to assess VCEs in process plants, little attention has been paid to the spatial-temporal evolution of VCEs. This study, therefore, aims to develop a dynamic methodology based on discrete dynamic event tree to assess the likelihood of VCEs and the vulnerability of installations. The developed methodology consists of six steps: (i) identification of hazardous installations and potential loss of containment (LOC), (ii) analysis of vapor cloud dispersion, (iii) identification and characterization of ignition sources, (iv) explosion frequency and delayed time assessment using the dynamic event tree, (v) overpressure calculation by the Multi-Energy method and (vi) damage assessment based on probit models. This methodology considers the time dependencies in vapor cloud dispersion and in the uncertainty of delayed ignitions. Application of the methodology to a case study shows that the methodology can reflect the characteristics of large VCEs and avoid underestimating the consequences. Besides, this study indicates that ignition control may be regarded as a delay measure, effective emergency actions are needed for preventing VCEs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Dynamic event tree; Process plants; Spatial-temporal evolution; Uncertainty modeling; Vapor cloud explosion,Accidents; Disasters; Dispersions; Damage assessments; Discrete dynamic event trees; Ignition control; Ignition source; Spatial-temporal evolution; Time dependency; Vapor cloud explosions; Vulnerability assessments; Damage detection,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083291175

This study investigates chemical safety in China in order to identify the causes of the major accidents and accompanying casualties, formulating the safety management needs to develop a sustainable chemical industry in China. First, we analyze the evolution and current status of China's chemical industry to identify possible safety issues rooted in the industry. Second, a thorough accident investigation is conducted based on official statistics and collected chemical accidents in China in the period 2004–2019. Furtherly, the main laws, regulations, guidelines, standards and measures related to chemical safety are analyzed and compared with those in Europe. According to analyses related to the chemical industry, chemical accidents and safety legislation and measures in China and Europe, the current problems with respect to chemical safety in China are discussed systematically. Based on research findings, we propose recommendations for the improvement of chemical safety so as to promote the sustainable development of the chemical industry in China.

The outcome of this inquiry is that the acceptability of a decision is to be assessed by a plurality of ‘publics’, including that of a local community. Even though a plurality of ‘publics’ might create competing normative demands, its acknowledgment is necessary to withstand the monopolization of the process of technology appraisal. The paper presents four ways in which such an appropriation of publicness takes place. The creation of dedicated ‘local publics’, in contrast, helps to overcome these problems and allows for more responsible forms of decision-making. We describe ‘local publics’ as those in which stakeholders from the different publics that are related to the process of technology implementation are brought together, and in which concerns and issues from these publics are deliberated upon. The paper will present eight conditions for increasing the effectiveness of such ‘local publics’. © 2020, The Author(s).",Expertise; Local democracy; Responsibility; Technology appraisal,decision making; technology; Decision Making; Technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079807192

Research developing in recent decades has found that limitations to mobility and accessibility can reduce satisfaction with life. To date, research in this field assumes a linear and one-way relationship between the two—i.e. that ‘more mobility’ results in ‘more life satisfaction’. Yet diminishing marginal returns on happiness are found in many related fields such as economics, and there is always the possibility that happier people travel more than unhappy people. To the authors’ knowledge, this paper presents the first attempt to look for evidence of a non-linear relationship between mobility (measured as trip-making) and life satisfaction, and the first to test the direction of causality between the two factors. It uses a sample of some 1500 adults in the Netherlands Mobility Panel. Linear and segmented regression models were used to associate trip-making with satisfaction with life, when controlling for income, age, self-rated health and other demographics. Counter to expectations, five different model specifications suggest that the relationship between trip-making and satisfaction with life is linear. Furthermore, a structural equation model found that the relationship between mobility and satisfaction could run in either direction. This study questions many of the assumptions made about the relationship between transport and subjective well-being. Given the increasing prominence of this topic, much research is needed to further explore these complex relationships. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Mobility; Satisfaction with life; Transportation; Well-being,Carrier mobility; Regression analysis; Transportation; Complex relationships; Model specifications; Non-linear relationships; Satisfaction with life; Segmented regressions; Social activities; Structural equation modeling; Well being; Behavioral research; adult; economic activity; life satisfaction; mobility; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076199841

Based on data from both countries’ national travel surveys, the empirical analyses show that people of immigrant origin cycle less compared to natives. While in Denmark this effect is significant only for people of non-Western origin, in the Netherlands it is also true for people of Western origin, probably because they originate to a greater extent from non-European countries (e.g., Indonesia). In the Netherlands, the effect of non-Western origin is larger for women than for men, while we do not find a significant gender interaction in the Danish data. Individuals with residence in neighbourhoods with a higher share of people of non-Western origin are less likely to cycle, probably as the national norm to cycle is less salient here. The results cannot be fully explained by differences in socioeconomic status, car access, or level of urbanisation. We assume that cultural norms mediated by parents play a relevant role. The results lend support to policies focused on stimulating the use of the bicycle among immigrants and especially women of non-Western origin. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Cycling; Cycling culture; Immigrants; Mode choice; National travel survey; Travel socialization,Civil engineering; Transportation; Cycling; Immigrants; Mode choice; National travel surveys; Travel socialization; Surveys; car use; culture; cycle transport; immigrant; socioeconomic status; urbanization; Denmark; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060779805

In the European Union, balancing markets are undergoing substantial regulatory changes driven the efforts to harmonize the market design and better align it with the goals of the energy transition. It is proposed to decouple the balancing energy (real-time) market from the (forward) balancing capacity market and the price of balancing energy will be based on the marginal bid. In this paper, the potential effects of these changes on market participants’ strategies are analyzed using an agent-based model. This model compares the effects of a standalone balancing energy market with different pricing rules on economic efficiency with agents that apply naïve, rule-based and reinforcement-learning strategies. The results indicate that the introduction of a standalone balancing energy market reduces the cost of balancing, even in a concentrated market with strategic bidders. Marginal pricing consistently leads to lower weighted average prices than pay-as-bid pricing, regardless of the level of competition. Nevertheless, in an oligopoly with actors bidding strategically, prices can deviate from the competitive benchmark by a factor of 4–5. This implies that the introduction of a standalone balancing energy market does not entirely solve the issue of strategic bidding, but helps dampen the prices, as compared to the balancing market prior to the design change. © 2020 The Authors",Agent-based modeling; Balancing market; Bidding strategy; Market efficiency; Reinforcement learning,Autonomous agents; Competition; Computational methods; Economic and social effects; Learning systems; Power markets; Reinforcement learning; Agent-based model; Economic efficiency; Energy transitions; Market participants; Model-based analysis; Pay-as-bid pricing; Strategic bidding; Weighted average prices; Costs; cost analysis; electricity generation; electricity supply; energy balance; energy market; energy planning; oligopoly; price dynamics; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085014445

Therefore, it is significant and urgent to summarize the state of art and research needs in the field of CIP safety. In this paper, a keyword co-occurrence analysis of 116 scientific articles was conducted to support the classification of research topics in this field, then an overview of those research topics was presented to investigate the evolution of safety research with respect to CIPs. Specifically, the way that safety assessments are conducted, as well as how safety management and safety technology in such areas are classified and investigated, followed by detailed descriptions of representative methods and their contributions to CIP safety, are discussed. An integrated safety framework for CIPs is proposed to organize safety approaches and measures systematically. Based on the classification and analysis of studies on management, assessment, and technology related to CIP safety, the research trends and future directions and challenges are discussed and outlined.

Despite growing scientific interests, analyses of commons evolution and temporal dynamics are rare and drivers of change (birth, adaptation, dissolution) remain obscure. We apply an interdisciplinary approach and address these issues from an eco-evolutionary perspective. Analyses of &gt; 400 Dutch commons over more than a millennium (between the 9th and the 20th century) uncovered that most commons originated between 1200 and 1700, and that there was a particularly high rate of evolution during 1300-1550, a pattern intermediate to gradualism and punctuated equilibrium in biological evolution. Dissolutions of commons were rare prior to 1800 and peaked around 1850, comparable to a mass extinction in biology. Temporal trends in number, spatial distribution, density, and dispersion of historical commons were distinctive and resembled developments seen at the levels of species and individuals in the growth of biological communities and populations, in that they showed signs of saturation determined by the abundance and distribution of resources. The spatiotemporal dynamics of commons also pointed to important roles of social, economic and political factors, such as new reclamations of resources and pressure on resources due to population growth. Despite internal and external pressures, the self-governing commons studied here were very successful, in the sense that they persisted for on average &gt;350 years. There was a weak positive relationship between the use of multiple resources and the lifespan of commons, resembling associations between diversity and persistence seen in biological systems. It is argued that eco-evolutionary perspectives can further the understanding of the long-term dynamics of commons as institutions for collective action, vitalize future research, improve management of shared goods, and advise about sustainable utilization of finite resources.

In 2019, there were 395 natural disasters that caused 11,755 deaths. Literature and practice indicate that diversification of disaster risk management (DRM) approaches can make communities more resilient. One notable bottleneck in adopting diverse DRM approaches is the historical dominance of natural and technological sciences with little contribution from social sciences. Thus, a heterogeneous social-technical approach to DRM is rare and risk governance challenges are hardly understood. We conducted a systematic literature and practice review and extracted data to develop and answer five sub-questions. After that, we reviewed relevant information and selected eight risk evaluation approaches. We made comparisons and used the input to design the Risk Evaluation Diversity-aiding Approach (RED-A). The approach consists of 12 criteria and a checklist with 22 items. RED-A provides guidance to DRM researchers and practitioners when conducting socio-technical risk evaluations. It helps identify cognitive biases in the ongoing DRM process that may largely impact the quality of risk evaluation procedures. The goal of the 22-item checklist is to ensure that the 12 RED-A criteria are incorporated as much as possible to support the progressive transition towards a heterogeneous social-technical DRM approach. Finally, the RED-A criteria and checklist are applied in the Solotvyno municipality context (in Ukraine), to illustrate the use of the approach. © 2020 by the authors.",Ambiguity; Complexity; Decision-making; Design for resilience (DfR); Disaster risk reduction (DRM) measures; Embodied uncertainty; Risk evaluation approaches; Solotvyno; Tolerability and acceptability judgments,damage mechanics; design; disaster management; heterogeneity; mortality; multicriteria analysis; natural disaster; Ukraine,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088013820

This study adds to the rich body of road pricing acceptability literature by taking a different approach that focuses on the underlying pattern of the arguments, beliefs and attitudes, which largely determine the viewpoint of individuals with respect to road pricing. We apply Q-methodology to find these viewpoints by asking respondents to rank order subjective arguments that are subtracted from the public debate on road pricing and to identify shared viewpoints that are called frames. Analysis revealed four frames: The polluter should pay, Focus on fair alternatives, What's in it for me? and Don't interfere. Only the Polluter should pay frame is positive about road pricing. The other three frames are negative about road pricing, which suggests that there is not just one single block of citizens opposed to road pricing, but that quite different arguments are used in the various frames. We discuss how these frames can be used by policy-makers that intend to implement road pricing, to fine-tune the design, communication and implementation process of road pricing schemes. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Acceptability; Congestion charging; Q-methodology; Road pricing,literature review; planning method; policy implementation; policy making; road pricing; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation planning; transportation policy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085065333

Consequently, we hypothesize that random regret minimization (RRM) may better describe evacuation behavior than traditional random utility maximization (RUM). However, in many travel related contexts, such as evacuation departure timing, specifying choice sets can be challenging due to unknown attribute levels and near-endless alternatives, for example. This has implications especially for estimating RRM models, which calculates attribute-level regret via pairwise comparison of attributes across all alternatives in the set. While stated preference (SP) surveys solve such choice set problems, revealed preference (RP) surveys collect actual behavior and incorporate situational and personal constraints, which impact rare choice contexts (e.g., evacuations). Consequently, we designed an RP survey for RRM (and RUM) in an evacuation context, which we distributed from March to July 2018 to individuals impacted by the 2017 December Southern California Wildfires (n = 226). While we hypothesized that RRM would outperform RUM for evacuation choices, this hypothesis was not supported by our data. We explain how this is partly the result of insufficient attribute-level variation across alternatives, which leads to difficulties in distinguishing non-linear regret from linear utility. We found weak regret aversion for some attributes, and we identified weak class-specific regret for route and mode choice through a mixed-decision rule latent class choice model, suggesting that RRM for evacuations may yet prove fruitful. We derive methodological implications beyond the present context toward other RP studies involving challenging choice sets and/or limited attribute variability. © 2020 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies",California wildfires; Discrete choice analysis; Evacuation behavior; Regret minimization; Revealed preference,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084526097

There is a lack of decision support methods based on intelligent algorithms to shorten the response time and to reduce the loss of life and property. The primary purpose of this paper is to develop a three-stage decision support method to optimize the type and number of resources when making SAR schemes so as to formulate emergency response more efficiently and effectively. First, the main influential factors are identified in Stage 1, including the particulars of environmental indices, search objects and SAR resources. Next, in Stage 2, important variables are defined for generating probability distribution maps, identifying the search areas, and evaluating the objective function in Stage 3. Two intelligent algorithms, the Differential Evolution (DE) and Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), are used to find appropriate SAR schemes and help resources scheduling. Finally, the feasibility and validity of the model are verified by a ship collision example. From the simulation of the SAR task assignment and decision preference analysis, the proposed method can be used for further improvement of SAR design and operationalization. © 2020 The Authors",Decision support; Differential evolution; Maritime emergency response; Multi-objective optimization; Search and rescue,Decision making; Genetic algorithms; Probability distributions; Differential Evolution; Environmental index; Influential factors; Intelligent Algorithms; Multi-criteria decision making problems; Non dominated sorting genetic algorithm ii (NSGA II); Objective functions; Resources scheduling; Decision support systems; decision support system; design; emergency vessel; feasibility study; genetic algorithm; mapping method; search and rescue,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084065712

One main task of the systems is setting off alarms for taking evasive actions. The alarms need to be triggered before the conflict has no collision-free solution. However, most of existing collision risk measures are independent of conflict resolution. That means the collision alert does not indicate that the collision is avoidable or not. This article proposes an improved time-varying collision risk (TCR) measure, bringing in a new measure. The measurement of TCR reflects not only the dangerous level of the approaching ships but also the difficulty of avoiding collisions. By comparing with traditional measures, e.g., Collision Risk Index (CRI), we found that (1) the TCR can distinguish changes of risk that have identical CRI level, (2) the TCR measure offers a reasonable tool to evaluate the collision risk of entire traffic, and (3) it reflects the influence of maneuverability improvement on collision risk. Based on those results, this article reaches two conclusions: the collision risk is monotonically increasing when introducing more ships, and ignorance of ship maneuverability results in an underestimation of collision risk. © 2020 The Author(s)",Collision alert system; Collision avoidance system; Collision risk; Generalized Velocity Obstacle (GVO) algorithm; Maneuvering margin,Collision avoidance; Maneuverability; Ships; Collision alert; Collision avoidance systems; Collision risks; Maneuvering margin; Velocity obstacles; Risk assessment; algorithm; article; avoidance behavior; conflict; risk assessment; ship,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082624679

In order to deal with the constant call for enhancing budgets, different policy measures have been taken to downsize the appeal to the judiciary and to improve productivity. One of the central questions hereby is whether these measures have actually contributed to a more productive sector. This paper focuses on the development of productivity in the judiciary and how policy measures have affected productivity. In this empirical analysis, we apply a cost function model to time series data of the Dutch judiciary between 1980 and 2016. The results show a dramatic decline of productivity over the entire period (−50%), in spite of various policy measures. The year 2001 can be regarded as a turning point, as since then productivity has remained more or less stable. It seems that this is largely due to the establishment of the Council for the Judiciary and the associated increase in (financial and operational) autonomy for the judiciary. Another striking result is that technical change is biased toward using more personnel through time. © 2019 The Authors.

However, studies that empirically test this assumption are scarce. Using the Information Systems (IS) Success Model as a theoretical basis, this study aims to examine the effects of data quality, system quality, and service quality on citizens' trust in OGD. We used Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze the 200 responses to our online questionnaire. We found that trust in OGD can be predicted by citizens' perceptions of OGD system quality and service quality. Furthermore, citizens' perception of service quality positively influences their perceptions of data and system quality, whereas citizens' perception of system quality positively influences their perception of data quality. This study is among the first that quantitatively examines the effects of data quality, service quality, and system quality on citizen's trust in OGD. It contributes to the scientific literature by providing an operationalization of elements of the IS Success Model in the context of OGD and by developing and applying a model of factors influencing citizen's trust in OGD. While previous research finds that perceived data quality is the most crucial driver for trust in OGD, our study finds that citizens' perception of OGD service quality is a more important driver for trust in OGD. With regard to the practical contributions of this study, open data policymakers should be aware that citizens' perceptions on data quality can be greatly improved when appropriate human services are provided (e.g., designated civil servants offering support or help to data users) in addition to the provision of OGD portal functionalities (e.g., data visualization and comparison tools). © 2020 ACM.",Citizen engagement; Data quality; Information Systems Success Model; Open Government Data; Service quality; Structural Equation Modeling; Systems quality; Trust,Data reduction; Data visualization; Government data processing; Information use; Quality of service; Civil servants; Information systems success models; IS success model; Online questionnaire; Scientific literature; Service Quality; Structural equation modeling; System quality; Open Data,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086895343

With recent technological developments, more data have become available to the controllers and advanced state estimation and prediction methods have been developed that use these data. To fully benefit from these techniques in the design of signalized traffic controllers, it is important to look at the quality of the estimated and predicted input quantities in relation to the performance of the controllers. Therefore, in this paper, a general framework for sensitivity analysis is proposed, to analyze the effect of erroneous input quantities on the performance of different types of signalized traffic control. The framework is illustrated for predictive control with different adaptivity levels. Experimental relations between the performance of the control system and the prediction horizon are obtained for perfect and erroneous predictions. The results show that prediction improves the performance of a signalized traffic controller, even in most of the cases with erroneous input data. Moreover, controllers with high adaptivity seem to outperform controllers with low adaptivity, under both perfect and erroneous predictions. The outcome of the sensitivity analysis contributes to understanding the relations between information quality and performance of signalized traffic control. In the design phase of a controller, this insight can be used to make choices on the length of the prediction horizon, the level of adaptivity of the controller, the representativeness of the objective of the control system, and the input quantities that need to be estimated and predicted the most accurately. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,Controllers; Design; Forecasting; Sensitivity analysis; State estimation; Traffic congestion; Estimation and predictions; Information quality; Prediction horizon; Predictive control; Predictive control designs; Technological development; Traffic controllers; Traffic management; Quality control,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087692297

It is necessary to provide a personalization of automatic driving decision for each passenger. The purpose of this paper is to propose a self-learning method for personalized driving decisions. First, collect and analyze driving data from different drivers to set learning goals. Then, Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm is utilized to design a driving decision system. Furthermore, personalized factors are introduced for some observed parameters to build a personalized driving decision model. Finally, compare the proposed method with classic Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithms. The results show that the performance of the personalized driving decision model is better than the classic algorithms, and it is similar to the manual driving situation. Therefore, the proposed model can effectively learn the human-like personalized driving decisions of different drivers for structured road. Based on this model, the smart car can accomplish personalized driving. © 2020 by the authors.",Data visualization; Deep reinforcement learning; Driving decision; Human-like; Personalization; Smart car,Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Reinforcement learning; Automatic driving; Classic algorithm; Decision modeling; Decision systems; Learning goals; Manual driving; Personalizations; Policy gradient; Automobile drivers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087452377

In recent years, increasing numbers of large new town projects have been planned and built in and around existing cities. These new town projects have frequently been employed by city governments as central elements of pro-growth strategies, based on ideas of urban entrepreneurialism, which seek to promote economic growth, project a dynamic city image, and increase urban competitiveness. This article studies how the pro-growth, urban entrepreneurial approach affects the planning and development of Chinese megacities. A conceptual framework focusing on land-leasing revenue and new town development strategies is employed to explore the linkages between urban growth mechanisms and urban outcomes. Empirical material from four cities in the Pearl River Delta-Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhuhai-is presented. The analysis indicates that new town developments in these cities have different levels of dependency on spatial expansion and land revenue, and emphasize different issues of sustainable development in their plans. Cities with a lower dependency on physical and economic growth are be more likely to emphasize the quality of the built environment and address issues of sustainable urban development more closely when planning and implementing new town projects. © 2020 by the authors.",Land-driven economy; New town development; Pearl river delta; Urban entrepreneurialism,conceptual framework; economic growth; entrepreneur; new town; project assessment; sustainability; sustainable development; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; China; Foshan; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shenzhen; Zhuhai; Zhujiang Delta,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086939923

The literature on community energy systems is dominated by the study of electricity systems. Yet, thermal energy applications cover 75% of the total energy consumption in households and small businesses. Community-driven initiatives for local generation and distribution of thermal energy, however, remain largely unaddressed in the literature. Since thermal energy communities are relatively new in the energy transition discussions, it is important to have a better understanding of thermal energy community systems and how these systems function. The starting point of this understanding is to study factors that influence the formation and continuation of thermal energy communities. To work towards this aim, an abstract agent-based model has been developed that explores four seemingly trivial factors, namely: neighborhood size, minimum member requirement, satisfaction factor and drop-out factor. Our preliminary modelling results indicate correlations between thermal community formation and the 'formation capability' (the percentage of households that joined) and with the satisfaction of households. No relation was found with the size of the community (in terms of number of households) or with the 'drop-out factor' (individual households that quit after the contract time). © 2020 by the authors.",Agent-based modelling and simulation; Critical factors; Energy community; Formation and continuation; Thermal energy systems,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Drops; Energy utilization; Simulation platform; Agent-based model; Community system; Electricity system; Energy applications; Energy transitions; Neighborhood size; Renewable energy technologies; Total energy consumption; Thermal energy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086398664

Geothermal energy, widely used in agriculture, has recently emerged as a local, clean, and sustainable energy source able to fulfil the residential demand for space heating and has received growing attention in district energy planning. However, failed attempts in the past and the lack of experience with direct application of this technology in district heating systems has increased uncertainty with respect to the technical, spatial, and socioeconomic barriers to be overcome between supply and demand. This calls for the application of decision support tools in order to remove these barriers and facilitate more appropriate decision making towards the implementation of smart thermal energy grids in local energy communities. This research explores how the network of actors, those who see opportunities in direct use of geothermal energy in the Netherlands, can work on the transformation of the current centralised carbon-based energy systems towards local sustainable energy communities. © 2020 by the authors.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work where a global cargo network comprising passenger airlines, full-cargo airlines, and integrators’ capacity was studied. We used estimated yearly cargo capacity between airport pairs as input to the model. After assessing network characteristics of the sub-networks representing different carrier types, the full network was obtained as a super-imposition of the individual sub-networks. The resulting network has both small-world and scale-free characteristics. Its topological properties resulted in a higher flow imbalance and concentration with respect to its passenger counterpart, with a smaller characteristic path length and diameter. This result is consistent with the larger catchment area of cargo airports, which heavily rely on road feeder services for the ground leg. Finally, we showed how different attack strategies result in hubs of hub-and-spoke systems or airports behaving as bridges between communities being attacked first. We believe this work to be of relevance both for academics and for practitioners in an era where, due to the soaring of e-commerce and next day delivery, new players are entering the air cargo business and competition is constantly increasing. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Air cargo transport network; Betweenness centrality; Complex network theory; Hub-and-spoke; Integrators; Network nobustness; Network topology,air transportation; cargo handling; catchment; theoretical study,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084829951

Overall, experts and academics consider more economic risks and assess these with quantitative methods and models, while other stakeholders consider political risks more. To avoid losing sight of risks that cannot be easily quantified and modelled, including some economic risks, impact assessment modelling should be complemented with qualitative research and active stakeholder engagement.

While there are moral reasons to allow every citizen to participate and have a voice on every issue, regardless of education and involvement, designers of participatory assessments have to make decisions about how to structure deliberations as well as how much background information and deliberation time to provide to participants. After assessing different frameworks for the relationship between science and society, we use Philip Kitcher's framework of Well-Ordered Science to propose an epistemic standard on how citizen deliberations should be structured. We explore what potential standards follow from this epistemic framework focusing on significance versus scientific and engineering expertise. We argue that citizens should be tutored on the historical context of why scientific questions became significant and deemed scientifically and socially valuable, and if citizens report that they are capable of weighing in on an issue then they should be able to do so. We explore what this standard can mean by looking at actual citizen deliberations tied to the 2014 NASA ECAST Asteroid Initiative Citizen forums. We code different vignettes of citizens debating alternative approaches for Mars exploration based upon what level of information seemed to be sufficient for them to feel comfortable in making a policy position. The analysis provides recommendations on how to design and assess future citizen assessments grounded in properly conveying the historical value context surrounding a scientific issue and trusting citizens to seek out sufficient information to deliberate. © 2020, The Author(s).",NASA expert and citizen assessment of science and technology; Participatory technology assessment; Science policy; Well-Ordered Science,human; technology; Humans; Technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083276816

A significant part of the mechanical integrity failure scenarios originates from material degradation and corrosion mechanisms which may develop over a relatively long-time period, possibly taking months, years or even longer. Mechanical failure scenarios from two process units have been worked out and visualized using a bowtie. The research project shows that the monitoring of early warnings can provide information about the current development of mechanical failure scenarios. In addition, early warnings can be used to initiate inspections if there is a likelihood that the mechanical failure scenario has been activated.

It is claimed that homeowners perceive hassle during different stages of their (customer) journey towards a green home; the awareness stage, the consideration stage, and the decision stage. It is further theorized that people delay taking green home measures in order to avoid the anticipated stress caused by the accumulation of these hassles. Exploring the hassle factor as a psychological barrier to a green home can advance the successful implementation of policies that stimulate sustainable housing.

This is done by empirically examining determinants of travelers’ compliance with social routing advice. To that end, we conducted both a stated choice experiment and a revealed choice experiment (which also collected stated intentions and motivations for revealed behavior). Results from the stated choice experiment indicate a significant difference in compliance behavior across different information frames, societal goals, sizes of travel time sacrifices and personality. These findings are less evident from results based on analysis of revealed choices; i.e., the main motivation for revealed compliance seems to be an intrinsic motivation to contribute to improved throughput, while the main motivation for non-compliance relates to perceived traffic conditions. Moreover, the size of the travel time sacrifice seems not that important as expected. Nonetheless, comparing stated intentions with real-world behavior suggests that a relation between intention and compliance frequency does exist. © 2018, The Author(s).",Experience-based sampling; Road network efficiency; Route choice; Social routing; Stated- and revealed preference; Travel information,Efficiency; Motivation; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Revealed preference; Road network; Route choice; Social routing; Travel information; Travel time; compliance; experiment; road; sampling; travel behavior; travel time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055756448

Researchers and sector stakeholders increasingly realize that this container market segment has its distinct dynamics and demands. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the reefer container sector, its most important characteristics and trends, and a systematic review of the academic literature on reefer containers and logistics. First the authors outline the characteristics, composition, and development of the reefer container market, showing its growth through modal shift (from conventional reefer ships and airfreight) and differentiation into new cargo markets and niche services. Secondly the authors outline reefer chains in terms of their relevant stages, stakeholders, and processes. Data on insurance claims shows that cold chain failure and cargo loss not only occur due to technical failures, but just as often due to organizational errors – especially due to hold-up risk at container transfer points. Thirdly the authors map the present knowledge on reefer containers and reefer transportation through a systematic literature review. The current body of research on reefer containers consists mostly of highly specialized, technical studies on product characteristics and quality preservation, monitoring and control, refrigeration technology, and temperature management. While technological advances in these fields have largely enabled the containerization of cold logistics chains, the first sections of this paper also highlight that many current pressing issues in reefer transportation are logistical and organizational in nature. Therefore, the authors propose a research agenda addressing these overlooked aspects, including supply chain coordination issues and implications of reefer market developments for port policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Cold chain; Container transport; Reefer; Reefer container,Commerce; Insurance; Refrigeration; Supply chains; Cold chain; Monitoring and control; Product characteristics; Reefer; Refrigeration technology; Supply chain coordination; Systematic literature review; Technological advances; Containers,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85080072733

Nevertheless, policy makers, city planners, and practitioners appear to have quite different expectations from what smart cities can offer them. This has led to the emergence of different types of smart cities and pathways of development. This paper aims to answer the research question: When comparing a selection of smart city projects, can we classify pathways for their implementation? We do this by using a cross-case research design of four cities to explore commonalities and differences in development patterns. An input-output (IO) model of smart city development is used to retrieve which design variables are at play and lead to which output. The four cases pertain to the following smart city projects: Smart Dubai, Masdar City, Barcelona Smart City, and Amsterdam Smart City. Our analysis shows that Amsterdam is based on a business-driven approach that puts innovation at its core; for Masdar, technological optimism is the main essence of the pathway; social inclusion is the focus of Barcelona Smart City; and visionary ambitious leadership is the main driver for Smart Dubai. Based on these insights, a classification for smart city development pathways is established. The results of the present study are useful to academic researchers, smart city practitioners, and policy makers. © 2020 by the authors.",Amsterdam Smart City; Barcelona Smart City; Comparative analysis; Design variables; Digitization; Input-output model; Masdar City; Smart city; Smart Dubai; Smart governance,design; information and communication technology; innovation; Internet; policy implementation; policy making; project management; smart city; social inclusion; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Barcelona [Catalonia]; Catalonia; Dubai [United Arab Emirates]; Netherlands; North Holland; Spain; United Arab Emirates,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086602242

Energy communities connected to the main electricity grid may be exposed to this increasing price volatility. Additionally, they may also be exposed to local network congestions, resulting in price spikes. Motivated by this problem, in this paper, we present a coordination mechanism between entities at the distribution grid to reduce price volatility. The mechanism relies on the concept of duality theory in mathematical programming through which explicit constraints can be imposed on the local electricity price. Constraining the dual variable related to price enables the quantification of the demand-side flexibility required to guarantee a certain price limit. We illustrate our approach with a case study of a congested distribution grid and an energy storage system as the source of the required demand-side flexibility. Through detailed simulations, we determine the optimal size and operation of the storage system required to constrain prices. An economic evaluation of the case study shows that the business case for providing the contracted flexibility with the storage system depends strongly on the chosen price limit. © 2020 by the authors.

In the face of dynamic and deep uncertainty about the future, flexible strategies which can be adapted in response to how the uncertainty is resolving are attractive. Traditional cost-benefit analysis cannot account for the value created through optionality. ROA sets out to amend this. There are however several profound problems with how ROA tries to do this. It is typically not clear what is the baseline plan, without options, against which value is to be estimated. Different baselines significantly change option value. Even if option value can unequivocally be established for a given scenario, ROA relies on expected values over a set of scenarios. First, this requires assigning weights, or probabilities, to scenarios. Given the long-time horizon involved in climate adaptation, these probabilities are meaningless. Second, the expected value over a set of scenarios need not obtain in any single scenario and is thus not a meaningful summary of option value.

The current research trends in this field are obtained based on the analysis of research work on domino effects caused by accidental events, natural events, and intentional attacks over a period of the past 30 years. A comparison analysis is conducted for the current modeling approaches and management strategies to pose their applications. Finally, this paper offers future research directions and identifies critical challenges in the field, aiming at improving the safety and security of chemical industrial areas so as to prevent and mitigate domino effects. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Domino effects; Intentional attacks; Management strategies; Modeling approaches; Natechs; Safety and security,Accident prevention; Chemical industry; Chemical plants; Domino effects; Intentional Attacks; Management strategies; Model approach; Natechs; Safety and securities; Industrial research; industrial area; review,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078545065

Several studies have argued that maximising demand coverage, reducing logistics costs and minimising response time are among the critical objectives when locating RDCs after a sudden-onset disaster. However, these objectives are often conflicting and the trade-offs can considerably complicate the situation for finding a consensus. To address the challenge and support the DMs, we suggest investigating the stability of non-dominated alternatives derived from a multi-objective model based on Monte Carlo Simulations. Our approach supports determining what trade-offs actually matter to facilitate discussions in the presence of multiple stakeholders. To validate our proposal, we extend a location-allocation model and apply our approach to an actual data-set from the 2015 Nepal earthquake response. Our analyses show that with the relative importance of covering demands ≤0.4, the trade-offs between logistics costs and response time affects the numbers and locations of RDCs considerably. We show through a small experiment that the outputs of our approach can effectively support group decision-making to develop relief plans in disasters response. © 2019 The Authors",2015 Nepal earthquake; Group decision-making; Humanitarian response; Monte Carlo simulation; Multiobjective facility location,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076834575

In this paper, we assess the viability of decoupling. First, we develop a prognosis of climate-constrained global growth for 2014–2050 using the transparent Kaya identity. Second, we use the Carbon-Kuznets-Curve framework to assess the effect of economic growth on emissions using measures of territorial and consumption-based emissions. We run fixed-effects regressions using OECD data for 58 countries during 2007–2015 and source alternative emissions data starting in 1992 from two other databases. While there is weak evidence suggesting a decoupling of emissions and growth at high-income levels, the main estimation sample indicates that emissions are monotonically increasing with per-capita GDP. We draw out the implications for climate policy and binding emission reduction obligations. © 2020 The Author(s).

It finds that while the roots of this literature can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s, most of it has been published from 2010 onwards. The following aggregate conclusions are extracted from the literature: renewable energy has many advantages over fossil fuels for international security and peace; however, renewable energy is thought to exacerbate security risks and geopolitical tensions related to critical materials and cybersecurity; former hydrocarbon exporters will likely be the greatest losers from the energy transition. Many of the reviewed publications share some weaknesses: a failure to define “geopolitics”; an unwarranted assumption that very little has been published in the field previously; limited use of established forecasting, scenario-building or foresight methodologies; a lack of recognition of the complexity of the field; a lack of theorisation. Most authors do not distinguish between the geopolitical risks associated with different types of renewable energy, and only a few distinguish clearly between the geopolitics of the transitional phase and the geopolitics of a post-energy transition world. A disproportionately large part of the literature is dedicated to critical materials and cybersecurity, while only a small part concerns the decline of former fossil fuel powers. Among those publications that do discuss the decline of fossil fuels, there is also an over-focus on oil producers and a lack of attention to the countries that rely heavily on coal, for example Australia, China, Germany, Indonesia, Poland and the United States. © 2019 The Authors",Critical materials; Energy security; Energy transition; Geopolitics; Literature review; Petrostate decline; Renewable energy,Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Publishing; Strategic materials; Energy transitions; Geopolitics; Literature reviews; Petrostate decline; Renewable energies; Renewable energy resources,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077519585

Best worst method, a generic decision support tool, is employed in the assessment process. The study findings reveal that “lack of financial support from authorities” is assigned the highest weight in the final ranking results. This indicates that the lack of financial facility poses a major challenge to the successful implementation of CE practices.

But, what does this say about Alexander Fleming’s praiseworthiness? Clearly, Fleming would not have received the Nobel Prize, had not a mould accidently entered his laboratory. This seems paradoxical, since it was beyond his control. The present article will first discuss Fleming’s discovery of Penicillin as an example of moral luck in science and technology and critically assess some common responses to this problem. Second, the Control Principle that says that people are not responsible for things beyond their control will be defended. An implication of this principle is that Alexander Fleming’s desert, which is based on his epistemic skills, remains untouched by luck. Third, by distinguishing different notions of praiseworthiness, a way to resolve the paradox of moral luck will be elaborated. Desert provides only a pro tanto reason to determine whether someone is an appropriate addressee of reward. Here, luck can make a difference. Forth, it will be argued that stimulating the quest for socially beneficial science provides a compelling reason to treat scientists with equal desert differently. Penicillin provides striking evidence for the importance of this quest and showcasing it incentivizes the making of socially beneficial science. Ultimately, it will be justified why Fleming deserved the Nobel Prize in at least one sense of the concept. © 2019, The Author(s).",Control; Desert; Moral luck; Penicillin; Praiseworthiness; Reward; Serendipity,"penicillin derivative; awards and prizes; history; human; technology; History, 20th Century; Humans; Nobel Prize; Penicillins; Technology",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074728621

To that affect, a stated choice experiment is conducted and the data are analyzed by latent class models in order to incorporate preference heterogeneity. The results show that around 40% of car drivers indicated that they are willing to replace some of their private car trips by carsharing, and 20% indicated that they may forego a planned purchase or shed a current car if carsharing becomes available near to them. The results further suggest that people vary significantly with respect to these two stated intentions, and that a higher intention of trip replacement does not necessarily correspond to higher intention of reducing car ownership. Our results also imply that changing the system attributes does not have a substantial impact on people’s intention, which suggests that the decision to use carsharing are mainly determined by other factors. Furthermore, deploying electric vehicles in carsharing fleet is preferred to fossil-fuel cars by some segments of the population, while it has no negative impact for other segments. © 2018, The Author(s).",Car ownership; Electric vehicle; One-way carsharing; Roundtrip carsharing,Electric vehicles; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Car driver; Car ownership; Carsharing; Latent class model; Preference heterogeneity; Stated choice experiments; System characteristics; Electric automobiles; car ownership; car use; electric vehicle; experimental study; heterogeneity; transportation system; travel behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055290364

Despite the wide variety of transport network criticality metrics, little guidance is available on selecting metrics that are fit for the specific purpose of a study. To address this gap, this study reviews, evaluates and compares seventeen criticality metrics. First, we conceptually evaluate these metrics in terms of the functionality of the transport system that the metrics try to represent (either maintaining connectivity, reducing travel cost, or improving accessibility), the underlying ethical principles (either utilitarianism or egalitarianism), and the spatial aggregation considered by the metrics (either network-wide or localised). Next, we empirically compare the metrics by calculating them for eight transport networks. We define the empirical similarity between two metrics as the degree to which they yield similar rankings of infrastructure elements. Pairs of metrics that have high empirical similarity highlight the same set of transport infrastructure elements as critical. We find that empirical similarity is partly dependent on the network’s topology. We also observe that metrics that are conceptually similar do not necessarily have high empirical similarity. Based on the insights from the conceptual and empirical comparison, we propose a five-step guideline for transport authorities and analysts to identify the set of criticality metrics to use which best aligns with the nature of their policy questions. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This longitudinal, time-series cross sectional case study describes the development of the education and training program for Major Hazard Control inspectors, acting as regulators from the Labour inspectorate, belonging to the Dutch Ministry of Social Affairs and Employment. A blueprint had to be constructed in order to assess the development and quality of this program in four cross sections over time. The description highlights both the safety related content and the regulator skills parts of the program in its changing context. Professional standards, educational objectives, quality of education, evaluation method, education change process and the response to the dynamic operational environment were examined. The main findings are that the education and training program kept the same main structure over the time period while its contents were adapted to respond to external context changes. Internal evaluation of performance data and education style led to a shift in contents from theoretical knowledge towards safety management and inspection practice oriented experience related knowledge. An active teaching style, increased usage of professional standards and more systematic evaluation, starting from the blue print in this study, offer the best opportunities for further improvement. Current insights on regulatory performance lead to a recommended future perspective for the inspectors’ role to be translated into education and training: balancing empathy, inquisitiveness and support with control and enforcement, or rather: exert tough love, staying between too soft and too hard. © 2020 by the authors.

However, an alternative meaning of the word 'value' in the housing literature can be found in research into the values underlying housing preferences, applying research methods from the marketing literature. The explicit combination of moral values and housing policy and design is found neither in the academic housing nor in the philosophical literature. However, diving deeper into the housing debate reveals that there are a host of moral values already present throughout this debate that are often not explicitly articulated and explicated, such as inclusiveness, sustainability, autonomy, and security. The aim of this paper is to address the role of values in housing policy and design. By doing so, we apply the Design for Values approach (DfV).We argue that the DfV approach can help to make implicit moral values more explicit, which can improve the housing debate, housing policy-making, and housing design. The paper first explores which values are relevant for housing policy and design and operationalizes those values. Next, the paper describes key debates in housing such as: What is ""adequate housing"" in times of rapid urbanization and increasing house prices? We argue that by exploring the underlying values of these debates, stakeholders can create a better understanding of the current (lack of) fundamental discussions on housing issues. © 2020 by the authors.",Design for values (DfV); Housing policy; Inclusiveness; Sustainable community,design method; housing conditions; housing management; literature review; marketing; residential development; social inclusion; sustainability; urbanization,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082675045

To date, however, much of the empirical evidence related to the health benefits of active travel is based on cross-sectional data. As such, the direction of causation remains uncertain, i.e. does active travel lead to improved health or vice-versa, are healthier individuals more inclined to participate in active travel? This study aims to systematically assess the bidirectional relationships between active travel, on the one hand, and two relevant health outcomes on the other, namely body-mass index (BMI) and mental health. Method: To this end, random-intercept cross-lagged panel models are estimated using data from 10 waves (years) of the Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences panel, a panel that is representative for the Dutch population. Active travel was assessed using a measure of walking frequency and mental health was measured using the 5-item mental health inventory (MHI-5). Results: The results indicate that active travel does not affect later BMI levels, but, vice versa, BMI does negatively influence later levels of active travel, a pattern that is in line with earlier research related to general physical activity and BMI. Regarding mental health, the pattern is exactly opposite. In this case, the effect of active travel on mental health is significant, while the reverse effect is not (at the 5% level of statistical significance). Conclusion: Overall, the results underline the notion that cross-sectional estimates of the effects between active travel and health outcomes should be interpreted with care, as they can be the result of effects in either direction. In addition, the results suggest that the uptake of active travel may be increased by decreasing BMI levels in the population, e.g. via dietary programs. © 2020 The Author(s)",Active travel; Body-mass index; Mental health; Panel data; Random-intercept cross-lagged panel model,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082190641

Many studies related to EV charge scheduling found in the literature assume perfect or highly accurate knowledge of energy demand for EVs expected to arrive after the scheduling is performed. However, in practice, there is always a degree of uncertainty related to future EV charging demands. In this work, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) based smart charging strategy is developed, which takes this uncertainty into account, both in terms of the timing of the EV arrival as well as the magnitude of energy demand. The objective of the strategy is to reduce the peak electricity demand at an EV parking lot with PVarrays. The developed strategy is compared with both conventional EV charging as well as smart charging with an assumption of perfect knowledge of uncertain future events. The comparison reveals that the inclusion of a 24 h forecast of EV demand has a considerable effect on the improvement of the performance of the system. Further, strategies that are able to robustly consider uncertainty across many possible forecasts can reduce the peak electricity demand by as much as 39% at an office parking space. The reduction of peak electricity demand can lead to increased flexibility for system design, planning for EV charging facilities, deferral or avoidance of the upgrade of grid capacity as well as its better utilization. © 2020 by the authors.",Demand forecasting; Electric vehicle; Peak shaving; Robust optimization; Smart charging,Charging (batteries); Electric power utilization; Electric vehicles; Energy management; Forecasting; Model predictive control; Optimization; Predictive control systems; Scheduling; Uncertainty analysis; Degree of uncertainty; Demand forecasting; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Increased flexibility; Peak electricity demand; Peak shaving; Robust optimization; Smart charging; Electric power transmission networks,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081746342

The objective of this study is to model port choice and obtain insight into port choice decisions for European container imports from Asia. The importance of port choice factors and their impact on port market shares in the hinterland were investigated. Furthermore, sensitivity of the model in predicting the impact of increasing fuel prices on port hinterlands was tested. Containerised imports of 231 European mainland regions were compiled, based on shipping data, port statistics, modal split and gross regional products. Using literature sources, 11 port choice factors were selected; five of these were found to be statistically significant. These factors and their respective weights were used as input for a logit port choice model to analyse container port imports for 31 ports; the most detailed model yet. A varying oil price scenario was used to show the application and sensitivity of the model. Changing oil prices were found to have an impact on modal split and on the average hinterland transport distance. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Container imports; Hinterland; Maritime container transport; Modal split; Modelling; Port choice,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079750085

For instance, safety risk is usually calculated based on the scenarios’ consequences and likelihoods, while security needs to be determined by the assessment of vulnerability, the likelihood of attack and potential consequences. Nonetheless, there are also many similarities. Conceptual models, metaphors and principles that have been elaborated in the safety domain during the past century, many of them based on major accidents and their investigation, can easily be translated to the security domain.

Previous global model-based analyses, however, have focused mostly on energy supply transformations. Therefore, in this study we respond to this knowledge gap by analysing the future energy demand projections in both baseline and climate policy scenarios of global models in detail. We examine the projections for the industry, transport and buildings sectors across four models and three different reference scenarios from the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway framework by applying a decomposition analysis. We compare the projected demand side mitigation efforts to a more detailed, sector-specific, technology-oriented assessment of demand-side abatement potential for the year 2030. Without climate policy, model-based projections show that baseline emissions can grow rapidly in industry and transport sectors, but are also highly uncertain across models. The decomposition analysis shows that the key uncertainty across the global scenarios is the projected final energy per capita. For modellers therefore there lies a challenge to better understand drivers of future energy efficiency and service demand, that contribute to the projected energy demand. This model enhancement would moreover allow to evaluate policy measures that can impact this relation. The technology assessment estimates that in particular in the transport and buildings sector there is a higher potential to reduce demand-side emissions through energy efficiency improvements than implemented in the scenarios. Improved insulation, higher electric vehicle penetration rates and modal shift for example could reduce final energy demand to lower levels in the short term than currently projected, reducing the dependency on fuel switching required in current scenarios to meet the stringent climate targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Demand sectors; Energy efficiency; Global scenarios; Shared socioeconomic pathways,Climate change; Climate models; Electric insulation; Energy management; Energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Abatement potentials; Climate policy scenarios; Decomposition analysis; Demand sectors; Energy efficiency improvements; Global scenarios; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Technology assessments; Energy efficiency; climate change; decomposition analysis; demand-side management; dependency; energy efficiency; environmental policy; numerical model,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078871656

Box 5015, GA Delft, 2600, Netherlands","Psychological factors are generally thought to play an important role in the prediction of individual variations in travel behavior and travel related choices. To assess their effects in statistical models, three assumptions are typically made, namely: (1) the psychological factors influence behavior/choices and not vice versa, (2) psychological factors can be conceptualized as latent variables measured by observed indicators and (3) estimated between-person relationships are indicative of within-person relationships. Recent research has shown that each of these assumptions is conceptually and empirically problematic. This paper introduces to the field of travel behavior research an alternative modeling approach which has its roots in the emerging field of Network Psychometrics. This so-called psychological network model avoids the above mentioned problematic assumptions, by modeling the relationships between attitudinal and behavioral indicators as dynamic causal systems which can be operationalized as a network. We illustrate the new insights that may be gained from this approach in a travel behavior context. In particular, we estimate between-person and within-person network models using data from a (two-wave) panel survey containing indicators regarding travel modality use and related attitudes. Our results indicate that the extent to which the use of a mode is considered convenient is most strongly connected to the actual use of the corresponding mode, and that the convenience of using the car takes a central position in the attitude-behavior network. At the within-person level, no strong connections between attitudes and behaviors seem to exist. This latter finding serves as a warning against the practice, embodied in many popular travel behavior models, of interpreting associations between attitudes and (travel) behaviors as causal within-person relations. © 2020 The Authors",Attitudes; Between-person and within-person; Causality; Latent variable; Psychological network model; Travel behavior,Attitudes; Between-person and within-person; Causality; Latent variable; Network modeling; Travel behaviors; Behavioral research; attitudinal survey; conceptual framework; empirical analysis; psychology; public attitude; travel behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078442288

The empirical analysis builds on existing research exploring consumer behavior, and it studies a database of 713 bottled water consumers in Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Consumers with a higher level of education were less likely to be late consumers. Additionally, early consumers were more likely to purchase due to a purposeful search for a bottled drinking water solution. Since we control for location specific effects we highlight the importance of supply driven consumption in the BoP market. Furthermore, the results suggest that the two water companies may not be reaching their targeted low-income consumers but rather middle class consumers.

Second, we use this categorization to study the effectiveness of different types of interventions in specific contexts: physical (environmental); socioeconomic; cultural; and political and governmental contexts. In addition, we propose to extend well known design methodologies for successful energy interventions by making the role the context plays in these explicit.

Control over the resources required for digital innovations is often therefore dispersed among multiple actors. Actors may have conflicting interests and business models which cause collective digital innovations to come to a standstill. While existing research suggests various factors that block collective innovation processes, there is still little understanding of how organizations can overcome standstills, and progress to bringing digital innovations to market. The main question addressed in this paper is: How do collective digital innovation initiatives overcome standstills in order to progress in bringing the innovations to market? We offer a novel perspective on the process of developing collective digital innovations based on a longitudinal case study of mobile banking in the Netherlands. Our case shows how parties have collaborated to learn about new opportunities for distributing control and framing solutions, while the actual commercialization of the mobile payment solutions was performed by individual actors. The framework shows how digital innovations emerge through a series of collective innovation processes that build upon each other through control point driven network reconfiguration and reframing. © 2019, The Author(s).",Collective action; Control points; Digital innovation; Framing; Mobile payment; Network mobilization,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068315655

They use place branding strategies to become more visible. However, conceptual and analytical confusion exists on the subjects of place image and brand identity, and current studies are limited to single cities, neglecting inter-city relationships at the regional level. In this paper, we examine how place image and brand identity of cities in polycentric regions can be compared with each other. Inspired by Zenker and Beckmann’s network analysis approach for studying place branding (J Place Manag Dev 6(1): 6–17, 2013), a method is introduced to compare image and identity networks for polycentric regions. We use this to complement traditional steps of concept mapping (i.e. elicitation, mapping, and aggregation), and apply it to analyse the illustrative case of four cities in the MRDH region within the Netherlands. Results of the comparative analysis between the image network and the identity network provide both visual and quantitative insights revealing structural differences. The network analysis research approach can be useful to both policy-makers and researchers in analysing city image and brand identity, and to develop place branding strategies accordingly, even at the regional level. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Brand identity; City branding; Network analysis; Place image; Polycentric regions,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067894039

Despite significant advancements in science, models and concepts, routine implementation beyond pilot projects remains limited. To better understand why, we have looked into the complexities of nature-based flood defence implementation and its resolutions, modelling decision-making situations using game theory in three nature-based flood defence cases: The Markermeer Dikes, the Afsluitdijk Dam and the Sand Engine. We observe that nature-based flood defence games are of a multi-level and nested nature. While the decision of whether to employ a nature-based flood defence is seemingly made at the project level, this can only happen when it is coherent with the institutional context that is determined at the policy level. A social dilemma is apparent: while a multi-functional nature-based solution is attractive to a coalition of actors, it is not the most beneficial option for individual actors. Hence, they are faced with the dilemma of opting for their maximum benefit or opting for the greater societal benefit which is less favorable to them. This social dilemma can be tackled by making ‘smart moves’, as inspired by the Sand Engine case. The nested nature of the problem requires structural change in the institutional context to enable favourable conditions for nature-based flood defence implementations. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Building with Nature; Implementation; Multi-level decision making; Sand Engine, Afsluitdijk, Markermeerdam; Social dilemma",Decision making; Decision theory; Engines; Floods; Building with natures; Implementation; Innovative design; Institutional contexts; Multi-functional; Multi-level decisions; Social dilemmas; Societal benefits; Game theory; collective action; decision analysis; flood control; game theory; policy implementation; resolution; article; decision making; game; human; Markermeer; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076360119

We inquire: How did lay people use citizen sensing to find solutions to the increase in noise? Which perceptions/actions influence and facilitate the problem-solving potential of citizen sensing? We found that the main citizens’ actions leading to solutions are an adequate contesting of information monopoly through the production of valid data, as well as the challenging of institutional strategies to improve risk-related problem-solving.

In existing optimization models that minimize the total cost of the energy system, location-specific VRES production profiles are often used to estimate VRES potential, but land-use and land cover aspects have been largely ignored. In this study, we therefore connect the literature in land cover assessment, VRES potential estimation and energy system optimization modelling by proposing a spatially explicit planning approach. This approach was applied to a case of the Netherlands to showcase its applicability and strength and to give results towards various RES targets. A baseline land-use scenario, a scenario with stricter constraints on land-use that reflects social resistance and spatial policy on wind energy and, thirdly, a scenario assuming unlimited land availability were analyzed. The baseline scenario results show the optimal geographical distribution of the generation capacities over the Netherlands. Wind energy dominates the generation mix and storage is only present at the 100% RES target. Under the strict constraints on land-use, 92% of the suitable land in the country will be deployed to place wind turbines in order to reach 100% RES share compared to 37% in the baseline case. However, the cost of electricity only increases by no more than 5 €/MWh. The unlimited land scenario highlights that the regional optimized capacities are infeasible. Apart from the useful results from the case study, the proposed approach is a first-of-a-kind contribution to the literature and provides a data-driven way to operationalize the location-specific land-use of VRES such that the role of the constraints on the land-use of VRES can be revealed and that policy-relevant results can be obtained. © 2019 The Authors",Generation mix; Land-use; Optimization modelling; Spatial planning; Variable Renewable Energy Sources (VRES); VRES potential,Cost benefit analysis; Digital storage; Geographical distribution; Natural resources; Optimization; Planning; Wind power; Generation mix; Optimization modelling; Spatial planning; Variable renewable energies; VRES potential; Land use; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy planning; energy policy; energy resource; land use; numerical model; optimization; spatial analysis; spatial planning; wind turbine; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076182729

While the national and local level have received ample scholarly attention, thus far little attention has been paid to the regional level. This is remarkable because policy makers across Europe are wondering what governance of regional transition actually is and how to shape and implement it. In the present paper, this concern is addressed. The research questions are, ""What does regional governance of energy transition entail? How can it be conceptualized? And what does it mean in practice?"" The questions are answered by presenting the results of a multi-disciplinary literature study, presenting a conceptual framework on governance of regional energy transition, using insights from innovation and transition studies as well as from the regional and network governance literature, and applying this to the illustrative case of theWest-Brabant region in The Netherlands. West-Brabant is a relatively large region and was home to a pilot that involved the development of a regional energy strategy. Data collection involved twenty expert interviews, text documents and participative observation in workshops. Results highlight the relevance of each of the key elements of the conceptual governance framework. However, some are particularly relevant like structural characteristics of the regional actor network, actor characteristics, and regional governance arrangements used. The results reveal commonalities with regional governance in other policy domains.

Our first contribution is identifying population segments with distinct behavior by constructing a latent class choice model for the choice whether to evacuate or not. We find two latent segments distinguished by demographics and risk perception that tend to be either evacuation-keen or evacuation-reluctant and respond differently to mandatory evacuation orders. Evacuees subsequently face a multi-dimensional choice composed of concurrent decisions of their departure day, departure time of day, destination, shelter type, transportation mode, and route. While these concurrent decisions are often analyzed in isolation, our second contribution is the development of a portfolio choice model (PCM), which captures decision-dimensional dependency (if present) without requiring choices to be correlated or sequential. A PCM reframes the choice set as a bundle of concurrent decision dimensions, allowing for flexible and simple parameter estimation. Estimated models reveal subtle yet intuitive relations, creating new policy implications based on dimensional variables, secondary interactions, demographics, and risk-perception variables. For example, we find joint preferences for early-nighttime evacuations (i.e., evacuations more than three days before landfall and between 6:00 pm to 5:59 am) and early-highway evacuations (i.e., evacuations more than three days before landfall and on a route composed of at least 50% highways). These results indicate that transportation agencies should have the capabilities and resources to manage significant nighttime traffic along highways well before hurricane landfall. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Evacuations; Evacuee behavior; Hurricane Irma; Latent class choice model; Portfolio choice model,Decision theory; Hurricanes; Population statistics; Public policy; Transportation routes; Choice model; Decision-making behaviors; Discrete choice theories; Evacuations; Evacuee behavior; Portfolio choice; Secondary interactions; Transportation agencies; Risk perception; decision making; discrete choice analysis; empirical analysis; hurricane event; modeling; traffic management; transportation mode,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85078245434

That paper concluded that Value of Travel Time in an automated vehicle should be lower than in a conventional vehicle by salary rate, if the traveller works during the trip, and unchanged compared to conventional vehicles, if the traveller engages in leisure activities while travelling. However, these conclusions have limited validity, because the models, upon which they are based, contain a term whose interpretation differs across the models. This note clarifies this interpretation and offers an alternative extended model, which allows comparison across models. The alternative model provides an intuitive result: the facilitation-level of on-board activities determines the reduction of the Value of Travel Time in the automated vehicle. If automated vehicles provide identical work or leisure experience to out-of-vehicle locations, then the opportunity costs of travel time are erased and the Value of Travel Time equals the intrinsic costs of travel, which is strictly smaller than the Value of Travel Time in a conventional vehicle. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Automated vehicles; Comment; Microeconomics theory; On-board activities; Time-use model; Value of travel time,Automation; Compensation (personnel); Economics; Leisure; Vehicles; Automated vehicles; Comment; Microeconomics theory; On-board activities; Time use; Travel time; automation; automobile; economic theory; microeconomics; modeling; preference behavior; transport vehicle; travel time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075628276

A heat map (kernel density estimation) approach is used which allows city-regions to be identified in areas with a high patenting intensity, a proxy for high R&D expenditure. The methodology is independent of any pre-existing administrative boundaries and it can therefore be applied to identify sub-national concentrations of R&D expenditure worldwide. This is an important advantage compared to other statistical data which is often only available at the national level. The results provide insight into the changing worldwide spatial distribution of R&D expenditure between 1997 and 2011, including the rapid rise of Asian R&D city-regions as well as less dramatic shifts among European and North American city-regions. The results also highlight some challenges of identifying high R&D city-regions and estimating R&D expenditure using patent data, and the existence of very large high R&D city-regions which encompass multiple cities.

Accordingly, a meta-review of cloud SRs is needed to appraise the results of such studies and create an integrated understanding. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: A tertiary study was conducted using a systematic method to analyze SRs including two stages: searching and screening the SRs and thematic synthesis of results. As a qualitative data management tool, Nvivo software was used to support the research process, for data coding and synthesis. Findings: First, by searching electronic sources between the year of 2011–2016, out of a total of 142 identified articles, 94 articles were included according to pre-determined criteria, of which 76 articles were approved after qualitative evaluation. In the second stage, identifying the research themes, a map of the concepts and issues related to each theme was drawn up. The analysis shows that the quality of articles has improved but can be further enhanced using methodological guidelines as well as supporting tools. The research has focused more on the technical aspect, although there is an equal demand for synthesizing of cloud governance concepts. Originality/value: This is the first tertiary study which presents the main research themes and concepts of cloud SRs in form of thematic maps by using the thematic synthesis and SR methods. This paper also provides some recommendations to improve reviews after evaluating the quality of papers. This study can support reviewers for future SRs in the field and also helps practitioners and managers to have a better understanding of different aspects of cloud computing. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cloud computing; Governance; Systematic reviews; Tertiary study; Thematic synthesis,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073931762

In this context, the issue of unforeseen intervention delays is of particular relevance because its impact on cost and hindrance might be too costly for infrastructure operators. Building upon the 3C concept (Centralize, Cluster, and Calculate) for intervention scheduling and optimization, this paper investigates the effect of unforeseen intervention delays on the intervention costs and the corresponding closure cost of the affected interdependent systems. A stochastic approach has been proposed to deal with the uncertainty of such delays. Uncertain intervention times are combined by Monte Carlo simulations to obtain the probabilistic distribution of the total cost at the end of the timeline of an intervention program affecting multiple interdependent infrastructures. Also, the change in the statistical deviation over time of the total cost with respect to the planned (optimal) cost during the entire program is obtained. This analysis yields interesting conclusions, such as the need for specific mitigation plans conducted during the course of the program to reduce the cost generated by the cumulative delays, and the need for enhanced communication between infrastructure managers, which could bring significant (economic) benefits to all stakeholders by jointly planning their intervention activities. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.",Infrastructure; Interdependent systems; Intervention; Intervention management; Maintenance; Optimization; Unforeseen delay,Costs; Monte Carlo methods; Probability distributions; Safety engineering; Stochastic systems; Infrastructure assets; Infrastructure managers; Interdependent infrastructures; Interdependent systems; Intervention activities; Intervention programs; Probabilistic distribution; Statistical deviations; Cost benefit analysis,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107313591

Some recent trends, such as climate change, urbanization, and increasing system interdependence, have led to more frequent threats, with detrimental effects on WDSs. In recent years, resilience has been considered an effective approach to address those threats, for which it is difficult to estimate the likelihood and consequences (Henry and Ramirez-Marquez, 2012). In the literature, two approaches were used to assess WDS resilience. On the one hand, performance-based metrics were used to quantify the impacts of disruptions on the WDS. Specifically, recovery functions were developed to model the time-continuous system response following a disruption, during periods of loss and restoration of performance (Cassottana et al., 2019). On the other hand, indexes based on system attributes were developed to classify WDSs and identify structural vulnerabilities. For example, algebraic connectivity, clustering coefficient, and average path length were used as proxies for robustness, redundancy, and efficiency, respectively (Yazdani et al., 2011). However, those approaches were applied separately, and the relationship between the performance of WDSs and their attributes is still unknown. Hence, the question arises from the above analysis on how to identify the key structural factors determining the resilience of a WDS. The goal of this research is to understand how and to what extent different network topologies determine different performance losses and recovery behaviors given increasing magnitude of disruption, i.e., pipe breakdown. To this end, we consider different network topologies as case studies and vary their structural attributes, e.g., water source head and tank capacity. We then simulate disruption scenarios of increasing magnitude and model the resulting system performance by means of recovery functions for the assessment of resilience. The estimated parameters of these functions are useful for characterizing different system responses, including severe or limited performance losses and fast or slow recoveries. By systematically varying the network topologies and the structural attributes, the function parameters could be in turn associated with key structural factors. We find that, while increasing the WDS supply capacity results in limited performance loss in terms of satisfied demand for water, increasing the reserve capacity improves the robustness of the system by delaying the loss of performance. This analysis will inform the design of resilient water networks based on their topology and unique attributes. © ESREL2020-PSAM15 Organizers.Published by Research Publishing, Singapore.",Pipe failure; Recovery Functions; Resilience; Topology; Water Distribution System,Climate change; Computer system recovery; Recovery; Safety engineering; Topology; Water distribution systems; Algebraic connectivity; Clustering coefficient; Effective approaches; Estimated parameter; Loss of performance; Structural vulnerability; Time-continuous systems; Water distribution system (WDSs); Shape optimization,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85107270522

This incompleteness can happen either by obscuring emotions, showing less than the original intensity, misinterpreting emotions, or eliciting emotions without feedback and context. Online interactions and deliberations tend to contribute rather than overcome stalemates and informational bubbles, partially due to prevalence of anti-social emotions. It is tempting to see emotions as being the cause of the problem of online verbal aggression and bullying. However, we argue that social media are actually designed in a predominantly rationalistic way, because of the reliance on text-based communication, thereby filtering out social emotions and leaving space for easily expressed antisocial emotions. Based on research on emotions that sees these as key ingredients to moral interaction and deliberation, as well as on research on text-based versus non-verbal communication, we propose a richer understanding of emotions, requiring different designs of online deliberation platforms. We propose that such designs should move from text-centred designs and should find ways to incorporate the complete expression of the full range of human emotions so that these can play a constructive role in online deliberations. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Deliberation platforms; Online deliberation; Online emotions; Social media; Text communication; Well-being,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85103724903

In order to evaluate the overall safety and durability, these parameters should be calculated by some accurate analysis methods, which are hindered by slow computational efficiency and optimization performance. The improved deep Q-network (DQN) algorithm combined with the deep neural network (DNN) surrogate model was proposed in this paper to ameliorate the above problems. Through the study cases of different zoning in the dam body and the actual engineering foundation, it is shown that the improved DQN algorithm has a good application effect on inversion analysis of material mechanical parameters in this paper. © 2020 Wei Ji et al.",,Computational efficiency; Deep neural networks; Fluid mechanics; Hydraulic structures; Shore protection; Application effect; Engineering foundation; Environmental factors; Hydraulic engineering; Inversion analysis; Mechanical Parameter Identification; Mechanical parameters; Network algorithms; Parameter estimation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099298210

While the top-down governance allows for clear setting of emission reduction targets for industrial sectors and major cities, reducing emissions in residential sectors in smaller (the so-called low-tier) cities remain challenging and often unaddressed. This paper studies policy options to reduce emissions in residential sectors in low-tier Chinese cities. We conducted interviews and surveys in the city of Jingmen in the Hubei province and developed simulation models with feasible policy options and realistic consumption choice preferences. The simulation provided insights to the policies on reducing household coal consumption and ensuing emissions. Our research found that top-down restrictive policies such as coal ban and coal tax are effective in reducing emissions. They, however, restrict access to affordable energy for heating and cooking, especially within rural areas. They hence need to be combined with supportive policies such as electricity subsidy to yield long-term positive impact. © 2020 The Authors.

Containerized cargo is responsible for more than half of the inter-island trade volume, making it one critical freight transport mode in the Indonesia archipelago. We summarize the network topological structure by measures such as degree distribution, average path length, and average clustering coefficient. Based on the initial result, we find that the degree distribution of the container shipping network in archipelago fits a hybrid distribution. The distribution proves the studied network is not scale-free. With regards to the network structure, the archipelago's shipping network exhibits a short path length and a low value of the clustering coefficient, potentially rejecting the small-world structure hypothesis. These initial findings provide evidence that the maritime shipping network in a large-scale archipelago shows a distinctive pattern compared to other maritime shipping networks in the existing literature. © 2020 The Authors.",Complex network; Indonesia; Large-scale archipelago; Maritime shipping network; Network topology,Containers; Freight transportation; Ships; Topology; Average path length; Clustering coefficient; Container shippings; Containerized cargo; Degree distributions; Maritime transport; Network topological structure; Topological structure; Complex networks,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097715889

Despite its significance, no studies so far collected quantitative evidence on (i) how and the extent to which this transformation is currently underway and (ii) which drivers and barriers are hindering and leading this transformation process. This article aims at filling this gap by surveying Dutch public administrations. In total, 46 responses from different organizations were collected that provide insight into their transformation efforts. Findings show that digital transformation efforts had only a partial impact at the organizational level: processes, employees’ duties and tasks and information systems are going through a deep transformation, whereas the social system seems to be less affected by the transformation process. Moreover, the analysis results suggest that external drivers are the main motivation for organizational transformation, and that expected internal barriers do not de facto result in digital transformation. These counterintuitive results suggest that in public administrations only exogenous input result in a sense of urgency and that the perceived barriers to transformation can be overcome if there is sufficient external pressure. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Barriers and drivers; E-government; Organizational transformation; Socio-technical theory; Transformational government,Cerium compounds; e-government; Surveys; Digital transformation; External pressures; Internal barriers; Organizational levels; Organizational transformation; Public organizations; Transformation effort; Transformation process; Public administration,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096507359

Twenty years ago in The Netherlands, a stated preference (SP) study was designed for investigating the choice of time-of-day (departure time) and transport mode. A nested logit time period and mode choice model, largely based on this SP data set, was included as one of the components of The Netherlands national transport model (LMS). A new TOD SP survey has now been developed to obtain up-to-date information for the next re-estimation round of the LMS. The fieldwork was carried out in in 2019, followed by the re-estimation of the nested logit model of period and mode choice on the new SP data. The context for the SP is that of a tour (round trip) carried out by the respondent as car driver or by train, also distinguishing by travel purpose (commuting, business, education and other). This means that we are asking questions both about the outward leg of the tour and the inward leg. Both car drivers and train users are asked to participate in two SP experiments on TOD and mode choice: the first focussing on the trade-off between congestion or crowding and the departure/arrival times; the second also with differentiation in costs between peak and off-peak. Our tentative conclusion is that TOD choice seems to have become (relatively to mode choice) more flexible in the past two decades, in line with the trends towards more flexibility in scheduling activities over the day and a 24 hours economy. Moreover, we now estimate nest coefficients for both car drivers and train users (until now the assumption that had to be made in the LMS was that the nest coefficients for train followed those for car). © 2020 The Authors.

A perspective that has dealt with vast, complex systems is public utility. Public utilities are, for example, water supply networks and electric power grids. This study explores what we can learn from a public utility perspective when perceiving and organising OGD systems. We used a hermeneutic literature review combined with a snowballing approach, resulting in a selection of 39 studies. We compare public utilities and OGD systems to derive five lessons: (1) an OGD system can be perceived from a node-flow view, (2) the foundational data flow of an OGD system starts at data collection and ends at data used by the public in an everyday context, (3) the organisation of OGD systems needs to consider the combinability, interpretability, and boundless reusability of data, (4) OGD systems need governance organisations that cover the whole system, and (5) OGD systems could replace existing data provision systems and be made a public utility if certain characteristic problems are overcome. © 2020, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Open data; Open Government Data; Public utility; System,Cerium compounds; e-government; Electric power transmission networks; Public utilities; Reusability; Water supply; Data collection; Data flow; Data systems; Electric power grids; Holistic perspectives; Interpretability; Literature reviews; Water supply networks; Open Data,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096474340

In this network, the delivery personnel consist of a large number of people with a complex composition and high level of mobility, creating enormous challenges for the quality of service and the management of a crowdsourcing platform. Hence, we attempt to conduct a competence analysis to determine whether they can provide promised services with high quality, i.e., they are competent for their job. To this end, the competence theory is introduced, and a multicriteria competence analysis (MCCA) approach is developed. To illustrate the MCCA approach, a real-world case study is conducted involving a Chinese takeaway delivery platform, where the Bayesian best-worst method is used to determine the weights of the criteria based on the data collected from managers of the platform company. Also, the competence scores of the personnel involved are collected through surveys and data sources of the company. Given the weights and the competence scores, we use additive value function to identify the overall competence scores of them, which reflects the level of competence for their job. The results show that Skills is the most important competence, while Knowledge is the least important of the four competence dimensions. In subcriteria, four core elements are identified such as punctuality, customer service awareness, responsible, and goods intact. In addition to the importance of criteria, a ranking of a sample of personnel is provided, and almost half of the crowdsourcing delivery personnel's competence is below the average and vary significantly, while the relationship between the competence level and some other variables is also discussed. Moreover, the developed MCCA approach in this paper can be applied to analyze the competence of personnel in many other industries as well. © 2020 Longxiao Li et al.",,Crowdsourcing; Human resource management; Quality of service; Additive value functions; Complex compositions; Crowdsourcing platforms; Customer services; Delivery problems; Labor intensive; Number of peoples; Service network; Quality control,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85094849824

It presents a review of the boundaries of cybersecurity in national security, with a focus on the ethics of surveillance for protecting critical infrastructures and the use of AI. A bibliographic analysis of the literature is applied until 2016 to identify and discuss the cybersecurity value conflicts and ethical issues in national security. This is integrated with an analysis of the most recent literature on cyber-threats to national infrastructure and the role of AI. This chapter demonstrates that the increased connectedness of digital and non-digital infrastructure enhances the trade-offs between values identified in the literature of the past years, and supports this thesis with the analysis of four case studies. © 2020, The Author(s).",Critical infrastructures; Cybersecurity; Ethical issues; National security; Value conflict,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85091484561

Here, we define residential self-selection as “the tendency of people to choose residential locations based on their travel abilities, needs and preferences.” Debates relate to theory/causalities (including the role of attitudes), research methods, empirical findings (including the magnitude of the importance of residential self-selection for the influence of the built environment on travel behavior and the dominance of OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries), and the implications for planning. The main contribution is in translating the current debates into a research agenda. Challenging avenues for future research are partly inspired by these debates, and include changing attitudes, qualitative research, multiple causal structures, extending the scope to other areas than residential areas, the existence of threshold values for the strength of preferences to be important for residential self-selection, the role of perceived accessibility, non-OECD countries, and planning implications. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Attitudes; Causality; Land use; Residential choice; Selection bias; Travel choice,,Book Chapter,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090826578

The introduction and adoption of automated vehicles (AVs) are expected to have an impact on the development of cities as well, as the use of AVs may, for example, lead to more efficient road use and less need for parking spaces. In order to study those impacts, we developed a geospatially disaggregated system dynamics (SD) model, through the use of subscripts, of the Copenhagen metropolitan region. We used this SD model to explore the consequences of 12 main uncertainties related to the introduction of AVs on urban development and develop future scenarios following the exploratory modelling and analysis methodology. Our analysis led to two distinct scenarios. In one scenario, AVs lead to more vehicle use, which leads to more urban sprawl and more congestion as a consequence. In the other scenario, more shared use of cars leads to less traffic and more open space in the city. © 2020 The Author(s).

Having reliable predictions of workload using unobtrusive sensors can be useful for adaptive instructional systems, as knowledge of a trainee’s workload can then be used to provide appropriate training level (not too hard, not too easy). Previous work has investigated automatic mental workload prediction using biophysical measures and machine learning, however less attention has been given to the level of physical obtrusiveness of the used measures. We therefore explore the use of color-, and infrared-spectrum cameras for remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) as physically unobtrusive measures. Sixteen expert train traffic operators participated in a railway human-in-the-loop simulator. We used two machine learning models (AdaBoost and Random Forests) to predict low-, medium- and high-mental workload levels based on heart rate features in a leave-one-out cross-validated design. Results show above chance classification for low- and high-mental workload states.

However, the influence of multiple–actors on the decision-making process is ill-understood. Stakeholders play different roles and have different interests in opening and analyzing datasets. The objective of this paper is to understand the influence of the stakeholder’s roles and their interests in the decision-making process to open data. The roles-interest grid method is used to determine the stakeholder’s concerns and how they influence the decision-making process to open data. In addition to stakeholder theory, we employ muddling through and bounded rationality theories to create a comprehensive analysis of the decision-making process. Stakeholders are found to be diverse, where some are proponents of opening data, and others are risk-averse and do not favor disclosing data. Stakeholder’s responsible for the actual opening of data are often focused on the risks resulting in a tension between the ambitions of politicians to open data, and the practices of administrators and decision-makers. Understanding the stakeholder’s roles and their tensions can help to ensure better decisions are made. We recommend creating incentives for generating shared objectives. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Bounded rationality; Decision-making; Interest; Muddling through; Open government data; Roles; Stakeholder,Behavioral research; Decision making; Decision theory; Software design; Bounded rationality; Comprehensive analysis; Decision makers; Decision making process; Grid methods; Muddling through; Risk averse; Stakeholder theory; Open Data,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088510302

The current Coronavirus pandemic is such a crisis. The online sharing of emotional content during the Coronavirus crisis may contribute to societal value change. Emotion sharing via social media could lead to emotional contagion which in turn could facilitate an emotional climate in a society. In turn, the emotional climate of a society can influence society’s value structure. The emotions that spread in the current Coronavirus crisis are predominantly negative, which could result in a negative emotional climate. Based on the dynamic relations of values to each other and the way that emotions relate to values, a negative emotional climate can contribute to societal value change towards values related to security preservation and threat avoidance. As a consequence, a negative emotional climate and the shift in values could lead to a change in political attitudes that has implications for rights, freedom, privacy and moral progress.

The results show that the estimation accuracy in DA is more constrained by the choice of time intervals than the number of particles. Good accuracy can be achieved without many particles if the time interval is sufficiently short. An over estimation of the level of measurement errors has advantages over an under estimation. Moreover, a slight over estimation has better estimation accuracy and is more responsive to system changes than an accurate perceived level of measurement errors. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Data Assimilation; Discrete-event simulation; Dynamic Data-Driven Simulation; Particle Filters; Sensitivity analysis,Measurement errors; Approximate model; Critical condition; Data assimilation; Dynamic-data-driven simulations; Over-estimation; Particle filters (PFs); Real time measurements; Time interval; Discrete event simulation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087282573

Yet, there is limited research about the role of enterprise architecture in adopting big data analytics. This paper explores enterprise architecture roles and capabilities for the adoption of big data analytics by conducting a qualitative case study at the Dutch Tax and Customs Administration. The first attempt to adopt big data analytics was focused on integrating analytics into the current complex IT landscape, but this encountered many challenges and resulted in slow progress. To overcome these challenges, a separate department was created to quickly harness the potential of big data analytics. Enterprise architecture was used for impact analysis and to create a transition process. The findings suggest that enterprise architecture was used in different ways at the various stages of adoption and implementation, requiring different roles and a different set of capabilities. Enterprise architecture was found to be contingent on the type of technology and the situation at hand.

The growth and decline of these clusters largely depend on government policies. Large port clusters have more economic activity but are also characterized by negative externalities, such as air pollution. This study investigates the dynamics and sustainability of the Tanjung Priok port cluster. System dynamics are used to examine the issue, and port cluster sustainability is assessed by modeling the dynamics of the system over a 20-year timespan. The growth of a port cluster has been found to positively influence the regional economy and the level of employment while also damaging the environment. This study investigates further the impact of an alternative port cluster development program (namely a free trade policy) and shore power system (SPS) program policies on the sustainability of a port cluster. The model indicates that when a free trade policy and an SPS program are implemented in tandem to maximize the economy and reduce environmental damage, they provide additional benefits. © 2020 Faculty of Engineering, Universitas Indonesia.",Economy of port city; Port cluster; Shore power system; Sustainable port; System dynamics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085190094

The risk of being targeted by a damaging attack is increased when medical devices are used which rely on unmaintained legacy software that cannot be replaced and may have publicly known vulnerabilities. This review aims to provide insight into solutions presented in the literature that mitigate risks caused by legacy software on medical devices. We performed a scoping review by categorising and analysing the contributions of a selection of articles, taken from a literature set discovered through bidirectional citation searching. We found 18 solutions, each fitting at least one of the categories of intrusion detection and prevention, communication tunnelling or hardware protections. Approaches taken include proxying Bluetooth communication through smartphones, behaviour-specification based anomaly detection and authenticating signals based on physical characteristics. These solutions are applicable to various use-cases, ranging from securing pacemakers to medical sensor networks. Most of the solutions are based on intrusion detection and on tunnelling insecure wireless communications. These technologies have distinct application areas, and the decision which one is most appropriate will depend on the type of medical device. © 2013 IEEE.",Healthcare; legacy software; medical devices; security,Anomaly detection; Intrusion detection; Legacy systems; Sensor networks; Bluetooth communications; Citation searching; Hardware protection; Healthcare institutions; Intrusion detection and prevention; Medical sensor networks; Physical characteristics; Wireless communications; mHealth,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084954533

While there are many studies which examine the effect of a new urban public transport system on the values of neighbouring properties, the number of researches which focus on the identification of the benefits that businesses can expect is rather limited. The objective of the present paper is to identify parameters which have a significant impact on the business revenue, as well as to quantify that impact, focusing on the city of Thessaloniki, Greece, where a metro system is under construction A questionnaire-based survey took place, addressed to business enterprise owners and professionals in the surrounding area of ten of the planned locations of Thessaloniki metro stations. The data collected by this survey were reinforced with additional attributes of the businesses, such as their distance from the nearest metro station, and a statistical analysis has been conducted, utilizing also regression modelling techniques The results indicate that more benefits can be expected for businesses which are located closer to the metro stations, especially in areas with limited parking availability. The benefits are estimated to be higher for the land use category that includes restaurants/café/bars. Models of that type can be very useful in cases of implementing alternative funding/financing methods, such as Value Capture. For the implementation of such methods it is very important to accurately estimate the benefits that all the parties involved in an investment will gain. © 2020 The Authors.

Students are enjoined to ditch their laptops and return to pen and paper. Such arguments presuppose that notes are taken in order to be revisited after the lecture. Learning is seen to happen only after the event. We argue instead that student’s note-taking is an educational practice worthy in itself as a way to relate to the live event of the lecture. We adopt a phenomenological approach inspired by Vilém Flusser’s phenomenology of gestures, which assumes that a gesture like note-taking is always an event of thinking with media in which a certain freedom is expressed. But Flusser’s description of note-taking focusses on the individual note-taker. What about students’ note-taking in a lecture hall as a collective gesture? Nietzsche considered note-taking ‘mechanical,’ as if students were automatons who mindlessly transcribed a verbal flow, while Benjamin considered it an inaesthetic gesture: at best, boring; at worst, ‘painful to watch.’ In contrast, we argue that the educational potentiality of note-taking—or better, note-making—can be grasped only if we account for its mediaticity (as writing that displaces the voice), together with but distinct from its political potentiality as a collective mediality (as a ‘means without end’). Note-taking enables us to see how collective thinking emerges in the lecture, a kind of thinking that belongs neither to the lecturer nor the student, but emerges in the relation of attention established between the lecturer, students and their object of thought. © 2020, © 2020 Philosophy of Education Society of Australasia.",Agamben; Flusser; Nietzsche; note-making; phenomenology of gesture; potentiality,,Article,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083523984

The pandemic is also posing severe challenges to the scientific community, with scholars under pressure to respond to policymakers’ demands for advice despite the absence of adequate, trusted data. Understanding the pandemic requires fine-grained data representing specific local conditions and the social reactions of individuals. While experts have built simulation models to estimate disease trajectories that may be enough to guide decision-makers to formulate policy measures to limit the epidemic, they do not cover the full behavioural and social complexity of societies under pandemic crisis. Modelling that has such a large potential impact upon people’s lives is a great responsibility. This paper calls on the scientific community to improve the transparency, access, and rigour of their models. It also calls on stakeholders to improve the rapidity with which data from trusted sources are released to the community (in a fully responsible manner).

Research has focused on developing such tools and evaluating their use in workshops but has not measured tools' effects over time on real planning processes, on the participants involved, and on the final outcomes. The role that tools play in adaptation planning, therefore, remains unclear. A longitudinal case study was made to evaluate a PSS, the Adaptation Support Tool (AST), in a design workshop for sustainable urban water management, in Berlin, Germany. The case study also served to test the evaluation framework and generate insights regarding systematic evaluations of tools in planning processes. The case study was carried out over eighteen months, to capture both the details of the workshop and its longer-term effects on the project and participants. Our results show that the AST's most evident effects were (1) contributory and less tangible in nature (e.g., supporting learning), than directly causal and concrete (e.g., affecting planning decisions), and (2) a function of the process and context in which the workshop took place. This study demonstrates that making systematic, longitudinal evaluations are valuable for studying the role of PSS in urban adaptation planning. © 2019 by the authors.",Case study; Climate adaptation; Planning support system; Urban planning,adaptive management; urban planning; Berlin; Germany,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079598097

In this paper, we tap into this knowledge gap and study business model components and the challenges they face. We argue that the market value of renewable energy technologies will increase when new business models are implemented to overcome financial and institutional challenges. We complement concepts of the business model literature with the insights from the sustainable transitions literature. This paper addresses two research questions: What are the challenges of business and financial models in the transition towards decentralized solar energy driven systems? And what are the promising opportunities for new business models in a developing country context? To answer these research questions, we use a case study research design focusing on niche market development of solar thermal and solar photovoltaic (PV) technology in Lebanon. Data collection involved analysis of relevant text documents and expert interviews with 30 informants across different groups of stakeholders. Data analysis involved qualitative interpretation of collected data against concepts from the business model and Strategic Niche Management literatures. The results show that business model challenges initially were highly dependent on donor aid, which contributed to the launch and network creation of niche markets. Later, a shift to micro-finance and business startup models was observed, which showed promising development. Knowledge transfer and community empowerment were found to play an important role in developing new business models that involve consumers more closely. As this development is expected to take place more often, we expect that new opportunity pathways will develop in developing economies like Lebanon. © 2020 by the authors.",Business model; Consumers; Niche development; Renewable energy; Solar energy; Sustainability; Sustainable transition,Commerce; Developing countries; Finance; Knowledge management; Solar energy; Sustainable development; Business modeling; Consumers; Niche development; Renewable energies; Sustainable transition; Solar power generation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079005551

However, this method suffers from epistemic uncertainty as it extremely relies on expert judgment for determining the model parameters such as the rates and weights of the performance shaping factors (PSFs). Besides, given an operation consisting of several tasks, SLIM calculates the human error probability (HEP) by ignoring possible dependencies among the tasks. The present study is aimed at using Bayesian Network (BN) for improving the performance of SLIM in handling uncertainty arising from experts opinion and lack of data. To this end, SLIM is combined with BN to form the so-called BN-SLIM technique. We demonstrate how BN-SLIM can consider uncertainty associated with the rates of PSFs by using probability distributions. BN-SLIM is also able to provide a better estimation of human error probability by considering conditional dependencies resulting from common PSFs. The probability updating feature of BN-SLIM can be used to identify the PSFs contributing the most to human failure event. The outperformance of BN-SLIM over SLIM is demonstrated via an illustrative example. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Bayesian Network; Criticality analysis; Dependency analysis; Human error probability; Success Likelihood Index Model; Uncertainty modeling,Bayesian networks; Errors; Knowledge based systems; Reliability analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Criticality analysis; Dependency analysis; Human error probability; Index models; Uncertainty modeling; Probability distributions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072579629

Each container is equipped with a sensor that communicates its level at the start of the day. Given a history of observations, a forecasting model is used to estimate the expected demands and a forecasting error representing the level of uncertainty. The problem falls under the framework of the stochastic inventory routing problem and our main contribution is the modeling of the dynamic probability-based cost of container overflows and route failures over the planning horizon. We cast the problem as a mixed integer non-linear program and, to solve it, we develop an adaptive large neighborhood search algorithm that integrates a purpose-designed forecasting model, tested and validated on real data. We demonstrate the strength of our modeling approach on a set of rich inventory routing instances derived from real data coming from the canton of Geneva, Switzerland. Our approach significantly outperforms alternative deterministic policies in its ability to limit the occurrence of container overflows for the same routing cost. Finally, we show the benefit of a rolling horizon solution and derive lower and upper bounds on its cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Demand forecasting; Overflows; Route failures; Stochastic inventory routing problem; Uncertainty; Waste collection,Containers; Forecasting; Integer programming; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Software testing; Uncertainty analysis; Demand forecasting; Overflows; Route failure; Stochastic inventory; Uncertainty; Waste collection; Stochastic systems,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072577543

A key goal is cost minimization over a vast solution space. However, finding a minimum-cost system while comprehensively satisfying different stakeholders is challenging and lacks proper methodological support. Stakeholders often employ their own expert estimations for lack of suitable decision-support methods. In these settings, systems engineers typically require mid-fidelity, easy-to-use methods. We present a rigorous method that quickly finds minimum-cost solutions for networks with multiple sources and sinks, focusing on pipeline topology, length, and capacity. It can serve as a discussion tool in multiactor design processes, to demarcate the design space, indicate sources of uncertainty, and provoke further analyses, different designs, or contractual negotiations. It is applicable to a wide variety of cases, including many prominent infrastructures needed to mitigate CO₂. We prove that the optimal layout is a minimum-cost Gilbert tree, and develop a heuristic based on the Gilbert-Melzak method. We demonstrate the method's efficacy for a case set regarding solution quality, computational time, and scalability. We also show its efficiency and usefulness for systems engineers in real-world settings. Systems engineers can use the generated cost-optimal system designs to benchmark any design changes in real-world negotiation processes. © 2019 The Authors.

This study contributes to the literature by generating insights into the effect of travel information on day-to-day route choice behaviour based on largely explorative analyses using route choice data obtained from a real-world experiment. As such, our study complements confirmatory stated preference and laboratory experiments. We find that the provision of travel information leads to a decline in switching propensity and a higher probability that the shortest route is chosen. Furthermore, we identified six behavioural profiles, varying from switch-averse to switch-prone. Travel time information seems to influence travellers’ propensity to shift from one profile to another across different OD-pairs. Our results contribute to understanding of the effect of travel information on route choice behaviour, and as such help inform the design of effective information-based demand management measures. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Institutional change can be influenced by changes in core values - normative principles such as affordability, security of supply, and sustainability. Analyzing this influence, however, has been hindered by the absence of a structured framework that highlights the role of values in institutional change processes. This paper presents an interdisciplinary framework explicating how values influence institutional change in the case of the energy transition. We build on a dynamic framework for institutional change that combines the Institutional Analysis and Development (IAD) framework with the concept of social learning. This basic analytical framework is expanded by conceptualizations of values in moral philosophy, institutional economics, and social psychology. Our framework offers researchers and policy makers an analytical tool to identify how values are embedded in infrastructure and existing regulation and how values shape communities and behavior. It explains how value controversies can trigger social learning processes that eventually can result in structural change. Thus, this framework allows analyzing institutional change over time as well as comparing change patterns across spatial and temporal contexts. © 2019 The Author(s).",Energy policy; Energy transition; IAD framework; Institutional analysis; Social learning; Values,Energy policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Energy transitions; IAD framework; Institutional analysis; Social learning; Values; Economics; analytical framework; conceptual framework; energy planning; energy policy; institutional framework; interdisciplinary approach; learning; policy making; psychology; regulatory approach; sustainability,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077026893

Combined, all these factors can cause outages and together they can make electricity supply unreliable. The implications of this are many, ranging from minor inconveniences to major failures of critical infrastructures. A potential solution to ensure power supply during outages is to use local generation in the form of renewable resources to supply energy. This paper proposes a community-based mechanism that demonstrates that when community members can determine for themselves how excess energy generation is distributed, the power supply of specific members can be ensured. Self-determination is achieved by prioritizing and differentiating between community members as well as automatically and continuously redistributing energy, thereby adapting to sudden changes in supply and demand. Simulation results show that the proposed mechanism can be used to empower local communities to decide for themselves how local resources are distributed during events such as outages, ensuring prolonged power supply for differentiated members of affected communities. Harnessing the potential of renewable resources and smart technologies for intelligent coordination through empowerment of consumers to become pro-active participants is a promising solution for the future power systems. © 2019, The Author(s).",Energy communities; Local generation; Power outages; Prioritization; Self-determination; Self-organization,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85082013935

However, in practice, ecosystem considerations often only enter the planning and design process of ports when required by an Environmental Impact Assessment. At this late stage, most of the design is already fixed and opportunities to minimize and restore ecosystem impacts are limited. In this paper, we adopt a large-scale, ecosystem perspective on port development with the aim to identify ecosystem-based design alternatives earlier and throughout the planning and design of a port's marine infrastructure. We present a framework, termed the 'ecosystem-based port design hierarchy' (EPDH), to identify ecosystem-based alternatives at four hierarchical design levels: 1) alternatives to port developments, 2) port site selection, 3) port layout design, and 4) design of structures and materials. In applying the EPDH framework retrospectively to a case study of port expansion in Tema, Ghana, we establish that ecosystem considerations played only a limited role in identifying and evaluating alternatives at all four design levels in the case study, whereas more eco-friendly alternatives in terms of port layouts, structures, and materials are identified using the EPDH framework. This reveals that opportunities for ecosystem-friendly port designs may have been missed and demonstrates the need for and the potential added value of our framework. The framework can assist practitioners in earlier and wider identification of ecosystem-based alternatives for a port's marine infrastructure in future seaport developments and, hence, represents an important step towards more sustainable port designs. © 2019 by the authors.",Coastal environment; Ecosystem-based management; Environmental impacts; Nature-based engineering; Port design; Sustainable ports,coastal zone; design method; ecosystem approach; environmental impact; infrastructure planning; port development; sustainability; Ghana; Greater Accra; Tema,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076711495

One of the main questions local governments face concerns the optimal configuration of school boards and size of schools. In this paper we analyse the relation between cost and scale in school boards and in schools. The influence of both the governing layer (board) and the operational layer (school) on average cost are jointly modelled. Board cost is modelled as an aggregation of individual school cost functions so that individual school cost data are not required in order to estimate the model. The results indicate that small schools (<60) pupils are operating under sizable economies of scale. The optimum school size is estimated at roughly 450 pupils, but average cost remains roughly constant with regard to size. In contrast to school size, the effect of board size (in terms of the number of schools governed) on average cost is limited. The policy recommendation is that municipalities should create at least three schoolboards within their jurisdiction and take measures in case individual school size declines below 60 pupils. © 2019 by the authors.",Cost model; Economies of scale; Local government; Multi scaling; School boards; Schools,cost analysis; economic development; education; local government; numerical model; primary education; public sector; scale effect; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85076673067

We call these interconnections 'hydraulic interactions'. The current approach to flood risk management, however, neglects hydraulic interactions for two reasons: They are uncertain and, furthermore, considering them would require the design of policies not only striving for risk reduction, but also accounting for risk transfers across flood-protected areas. In the present paper, we compare the performance of policies identified according to the current approach with those of two alternative formulations: One acknowledging hydraulic interactions and the other also including an additional decision criterion to account for equity in risk distribution across flood-protected areas. Optimal policies are first identified under deterministic hydraulic interactions, and, next, they are stress-tested under uncertainty. We found that the current approach leads to a false sense of equal risk distribution.

Yet, there is a gap in our understanding of how distances shape peoples’ travel choices. To understand global tourism patterns we map the flow of tourists around the world onto a complex network and study the impact of two types of distances, geographical and through the World Airline Network, a major infrastructure for tourism. We find that although the World Airline Network serves as infrastructural support for the International Tourism Network, the flow of tourism does not correlate strongly with the extent of flight connections available worldwide. Instead, unidirectional flows appear locally forming communities that shed light on global travelling behaviour since there is only a 15% probability of finding bidirectional tourism between a pair of countries. We find that most tourists travel to neighbouring countries and mainly cover larger distances when there is a direct flight, irrespective of the time it takes. This may be a consequence of one-way cyclic tourism that we uncover by analysing the triangles that are formed by the network of flows in the International Tourism Network. © 2019 Verma et al.

Rather, their incorporation into our thinking and planning of health and social care is essential if we are to respond adequately to the problems that confront us: they need to be seen not as “ethical add-ons” but core components of any genuinely integrated, realistic and conceptually sound account of healthcare practice. This, the tenth philosophy thematic edition of the journal, presents papers conducting urgent research into the social context of scientific knowledge and the significance of viewing clinical knowledge not as something that “sits within the minds” of researchers and practitioners, but as a relational concept, the product of social interactions. It includes papers on the nature of reasoning and evidence, the on-going problems of how to ‘integrate’ different forms of scientific knowledge with broader, humanistic understandings of reasoning and judgement, patient and community perspectives. Discussions of the epistemological contribution of patient perspectives to the nature of care, and the crucial and still under-developed role of phenomenology in medical epistemology, are followed by a broad range of papers focussing on shared decision-making, analysing its proper meaning, its role in policy, methods for realising it and its limitations in real-world contexts. © 2019, Blackwell Publishing Ltd.

For the individual scholar, this may lead to serious conflicts when working on joint university–industry projects. Differences in goals, such as the university’s aim to disseminate knowledge while industry aims to appropriate knowledge, might lead to complicated situations and conflicts of interest. The detailed cases of two electrical engineers and two architects working at two different universities of technology illustrate the kinds of problems individual scholars face in university–business collaborations. These cases are based on qualitative interviews and additional data and demonstrate that, while value conflicts emerge on the organizational level, it is primarily the individual researcher who must deal with such conflicts. This analysis adds to existing studies in two ways: first, it explicitly addresses normative issues framed in terms of ethical and social values, thereby going beyond the common social-science perspective of university–business collaboration. Secondly, it provides qualitative insights, thereby identifying details and issues not apparent in quantitative studies. In particular, it is evident that university–industry collaborations are prone to value conflicts not only in research but also in education and job training. © 2019, The Author(s).",Academics; Universities of technology; University–industry collaborations; Value conflicts; Values,"architecture; commercial phenomena; conflict of interest; cooperation; engineering; ethics; human; industry; knowledge; motivation; personnel; research ethics; science; social psychology; technology; university; vocational education; Architecture; Commerce; Conflict of Interest; Cooperative Behavior; Education, Professional; Engineering; Ethics; Ethics, Research; Goals; Humans; Industry; Knowledge; Research Personnel; Science; Social Values; Technology; Universities",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074592853

The analysis focuses on the interactions between public transport systems and MaaS developments in Amsterdam, Birmingham, and Helsinki. Case comparison is informed by the multilevel perspective on socio-technical transitions and literature on meta-governance of networks. Drawing on these frameworks and empirical findings, the paper identifies six governance approaches to MaaS across cases: analyser, architect, convener, experimenter, lawmaker, and provider. These basic models encompass strategies ranging from hands-on strong intervention to information collection efforts. Consistent with the transitions literature, these six approaches indicate that public transport regimes seek to control the apparent disruptive potential of MaaS by incrementally absorbing innovations; to this end, regime actors adopt governance responses that tend to reproduce existing institutionalised ways of doing and prevailing logics. Furthermore, the six approaches reveal intense interaction between regime and niche, suggesting that a niche-regime space might have emerged in the cases; actors travel and operate across niche, regime, and niche-regimes, mainly driven by concerns with market share and revenue streams in the mobility system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Governance theories; Meta-governance; Mobility as a Service (MaaS); Multilevel perspective (MLP); Public transport,Public policy; Transportation; Empirical findings; Governance theories; Information collections; Meta-governance; Multilevel perspective (MLP); Public transport; Public transport systems; Socio-technical transitions; Competition; governance approach; mobility; policy approach; policy implementation; public transport; transportation policy; Amsterdam [North Holland]; Birmingham [England]; England; Finland; Helsinki; Netherlands; North Holland; United Kingdom; Varsinais-Suomi,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072596858

To address this, we pose the question: What are the social, organizational, and governance factors that explain success with ‘local low-carbon energy initiatives’ (LLCEIs)? To answer this question, claims were first established pertaining to three groups of social factors: i.e. (i) those related to the LLCEI itself; (ii) factors related to the interaction between an LLCEI and the local community; and (iii) the presence of supportive governance settings and linkages with local government and intermediaries. These were analyzed using a variable-oriented cross-case design involving fourteen LLCEIs in the Dutch Province of Fryslân. Results show that there is a difference in the sets of factors that positively correlate with various measures of LLCEI success. Factors related to the LLCEI (i.e. internal organizational factors) correlate with collective energy projects and to a lesser extent with individual projects realized. Items related to interactions of the LLCEI with the local community primarily correlate with the customer base and to a lesser extent with individual projects realized. Finally, items related to the governance setting correlate most strongly with individual projects realized. © 2019 The Authors",Community energy; Cooperatives; Governance; Intermediaries; Low carbon; Renewable energy; Social capital,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071860516

Despite this truism, the concept has yet to be integrated into organizational safety culture theory. The purpose of this article is to bring awareness as to how national culture can influence organizational safety culture. We do so by theorizing that the shared organizational beliefs, assumptions, and values related to safety (i.e., the anthropologic component of safety culture) are a reflection of the national culture in which the organization's workers are embedded. These organizational values, beliefs, and assumptions directly influence worker perceptions of organizational life and their behavioral choices. Given this prospectively strong direct influence on organizational behavior, we reason that the effectiveness of different organizational structure designs, safety management practices, and leadership characteristics (i.e., safety culture's normative component) can depend on characteristics of the national culture within which the organization resides. We conclude by providing a few key practical suggestions and directions for future research. © 2019",National culture; Organizational safety culture; Societal culture,Human behaviors; National cultures; Organizational behavior; Organizational safety culture; Organizational structures; Safety culture; Safety management; Behavioral research; awareness; drug safety; human; leadership; organizational structure; perception; review; worker,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069644922

Meanwhile, the autonomous ship maneuvering decision-making influencing factors constitute a typical grey system, which is suitable for research by grey relational analysis. Furthermore, in the fuzzy approach, linguistic assessment of factors is evaluated to obtain priorities numbers. Therefore, this study mainly focuses on the concept of human-like maneuvering for autonomous ships. Based on experimental data of experienced seafarers and using a simulation platform under the scenario of the Shanghai Waigaoqiao wharf, an inference model utilizing grey and fuzzy theories is proposed. The proposed model combined with expert linguistic terms in order to select the ship maneuvering decision-making main influencing factors from multi-source influencing factors (in overall and separated categories of natural environment, ship motion, force parameters, draft, and position), and to study the decision-making prioritization for maritime traffic safety for specific ship maneuvering scenarios. This method can prioritize the main factors which affect maneuvering decisions as well as guide an autonomous ship-assisted or automatic maneuvering evaluation system for the research of human-like maneuvering behavior. This study provides a new perspective on the identification of main ship maneuvering decision-making influencing factors in theory and in practice. It can be utilized for better decision-making concerning maritime traffic safety of autonomous ship maneuvering, which in turn makes shipping safer and promote the application and spreading of autonomous ships. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Autonomous ships; Decision-making; Fuzzy logic; Grey relational analysis; Maritime safety; Quantitative assessment,Accident prevention; Behavioral research; Decision theory; Fuzzy logic; Linguistics; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Ships; Simulation platform; Unmanned surface vehicles; Force parameters; Grey relational analysis; Linguistic assessment; Maritime safety; Maritime traffic safeties; Multi attribute decision making methods; Natural environments; Quantitative assessments; Decision making; article; decision making; fuzzy logic; human; motion; quantitative analysis; ship; shipping; simulation; theoretical study; traffic safety,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069574271

Although each discipline has unique challenges and characteristics which can influence data sharing and re-use behavior, it may be possible to gain transferable insight from disciplines where these practices are more common. Several studies of the motivations underlying data sharing and re-use have been conducted, however these studies often remain at a high level of abstraction rather than providing in-depth insight about discipline-specific challenges and opportunities. This study sought to provide in-depth insight about the complex interaction of factors influencing motivations for sharing and re-using open research data within a single discipline, namely astrophysics. We focused on this discipline due to its well-developed tradition of free and open access to research data. Eight factors were found to influence researchers’ motivations for sharing data openly, including the researcher's background, personal drivers, experience, legislation, regulation and policy, data characteristics, performance expectancy, usability, and collaboration. We identified six factors that influence researchers’ motivations to re-use open research data, including the researcher's background, facilitating conditions, expected performance, social and affiliation factors, effort and experience. Finally, we discuss how data sharing and re-use can be encouraged within the context of astrophysics research, and we discuss how these insights may be transferred to disciplines with low rates of data sharing and re-use. © 2019 The Authors",Astrophysics; Interview analysis; Motivation; Open data; Open science; Qualitative research,Astrophysics; Laws and legislation; Motivation; Open access; Data characteristics; Data Sharing; Facilitating conditions; High level of abstraction; Interview analysis; Open science; Qualitative research; Research data; Open Data,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067201106

In this frame, eight co-creation workshops and five online crowdsourcing campaigns took place in Thessaloniki, Southern Tuscany, Rotterdam/The Hague, and Frankfurt, from which many innovative ideas to enhance Public Transport were generated by citizens. Purpose: A simple list of innovations would not be very useful for Public Transport Operators, as they cannot implement all of them at once. There was an obvious need for their ranking and this is the purpose of this paper. Methods: The ranking was realized with the most used Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis method in transportation research, i.e. the Analytic Hierarchy Process, using three criteria: Feasibility, Utility, and Innovativeness. An online questionnaire was distributed to experts, using a modified snowball sampling technique, which yielded 97 completed questionnaires. Results: Utility (42.90%) was found to be the most important criterion, followed by Feasibility (40.10%), and Innovativeness (17.00%). Four lists of innovations were derived, ranked with respect to a) all three examined criteria, b) Feasibility, c) Utility, and d) Innovativeness. The highest ranked innovation for a) and c) was found to be Mobility as a Service and platform with real-time travel, comfort, and multi-modal information; for b) City marketing from a Public Transport perspective; and for d) Advanced e-ticketing system.

Though humanitarian organizations have during the last decades made considerable efforts to improve the response to crises in terms of effectiveness and efficiency, HSCs are still faced with so many challenges, one of which is the incorporation of sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) in the management of their supply chains. In the literature, some authors have highlighted that the planning and achievement of sustainability performance objectives in humanitarian operations is hindered by the lack of decision support systems (DSS). Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-objective Master Planning DSS for managing sustainable HSCs. This Master Planning DSS includes: (1) the definition of a set of metrics for measuring the performance of a sustainable HSC; (2) an algorithm to solve the multi-objective problem; and (3) a Master Planning mathematical model to support the tactical planning of the sustainable HSC. Using the information gathered from field research and the literature, an illustrative numerical example is presented to demonstrate the implementation and utility of the proposed DSS. The results show that the order in which the three sustainability dimensions (economic, social and environmental) are prioritized has some impact on the performance measures. Therefore, it is important to fix a tolerance that would enable to obtain an acceptable balance (trade-off) between the three sustainability objectives, in line with the prioritization choice of the decision maker. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Disaster relief operations; Humanitarian supply chain; Master Planning; Multi-objective decision support system; Sustainability; Sustainable supply chain,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046623421

HSCs need to be flexible to adapt to uncertainties in needs, infrastructure conditions, and behavior of other organizations. The concept of ‘network flexibility’ is, however, not clearly defined. The lack of an unanimous definition has led to a lack of consistent understanding and comparisons. This paper makes a threefold contribution: first, it defines the concept of network flexibility for HSC in the context of sudden onset disasters. Second, it proposes a framework to measure network flexibility in HSCs. Third, we apply our framework to the 2015 Nepal earthquake case and provide evidence-based insights regarding how humanitarian organizations can improve network flexibility in HSCs. Our analyses for Nepal case show that delivery, IT support, and fleet criteria have the most influence on flexibility. Also, the application of our framework on the downstream network of nine humanitarian organizations shows low levels of network flexibility in all but one. This finding explains why several disruptions happened in relief distributions during the Nepal response. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",2015 Nepal earthquake; Field research; Humanitarian supply chain; Measurement framework; Network flexibility,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033716809

The risk factors of the earth-rock dam breach are complex, which vary with time during the operation period. Static risk analysis, limited to a specific period of time, cannot meet the needs of comprehensive assessment and early warning. By introducing time factors, a dynamic Bayesian network model was established to study the dynamic characteristics of dam-breach probability. Combined with the calculation of the conditional probability of nodes based on the Leaky Noisy-Or gate extended model, the reasoning results of Bayesian networks were modified by updating the data of different time nodes. Taking an earth-rock dam as an example, the results show that it has less possibility to breach and keep stable along the time axis. Moreover, the factors with vulnerability and instability were found effective, which could provide guidance for dam risk management. © 2019 by the authors.",Conditional probability; Dam breach; Dynamic Bayesian network; Earth-rock dam; Risk,Dams; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risks; Rocks; Comprehensive assessment; Conditional probabilities; Dam breach; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Dynamic characteristics; Earth-rock dam; Logical reasoning; Risk analysis methods; Bayesian networks; Bayesian analysis; dam construction; dynamic analysis; instability; probability; risk assessment; vulnerability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075576352

In previous studies, empirical models are often, to a limited extent, due to the inadequacy of historical dam breach events. Physical models, which focus on simulating human behavior during floods, are not suitable for fast analysis of a large number of dams due to the complexities of many key parameters. Therefore, this paper proposes a method for fast evaluation of potential consequences of dam breach. Eight main indices, i.e., capacity of reservoir (CR), dam height (HD), population at risk (PR), economy at risk (ER), understanding of dam breach (UB), industry type (TI), warning time (TW), and building vulnerability (VB), are selected to establish an evaluation index system. A catastrophe evaluation method is introduced to establish an evaluation model for potential consequences of dam breach based on the indices which are divided into five grades according to the relevant standards and guidelines. Validation of the method by twelve historical dam breach events shows a good accuracy. The method is applied to evaluate potential consequences of dam breach of Jiangang Reservoir in Henan Province, China. It is estimated that loss of life in the worst scenario is between that of Hengjiang Reservoir and that of Shimantan Reservoir dam breach, of which fatalities are 941 and 2717, respectively, showing that risk management measures should be taken to reduce the risk of potential loss of life. © 2019 by the authors.",Catastrophe evaluation; Consequences; Dam breach; Economy; Life,Behavioral research; Dams; Disasters; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Reservoir management; Risk assessment; Risk management; Risk perception; Catastrophe evaluation; Consequences; Dam breach; Economy; Life; Reservoirs (water); catastrophic event; dam; detection method; economic conditions; flood; reservoir; vulnerability; China; Henan,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075567256

This paper aims to investigate the effects of farmers’ entrepreneurial degree and network content (i.e., business ties, technology ties, and network heterogeneity) on farm performance (i.e., innovative performance and financial performance). The data set was gathered through a survey of 262 vegetable farmers in West Java, Indonesia. Our findings reveal that more entrepreneurial farmers (106) have more business ties, technology ties, and heterogeneous networks compared to less entrepreneurial farmers (156). Further analyses using OLS regression confirm that farmers who are more entrepreneurial and have more business ties obtain both enhanced innovative and financial performance, while farmers who link to heterogeneous networks obtain only enhanced innovative performance. Overall, the findings of this study demonstrate that more entrepreneurial farmers with networks that are rich in business ties and diverse contacts have better farm performance. © 2019 Royal Netherlands Society for Agricultural Sciences",Business ties; Entrepreneurship; Financial performance; Innovative performance; Network heterogeneity; Technology ties,agricultural market; agroindustry; business; entrepreneur; innovation; vegetable; Indonesia; West Java,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072707168

Recent progress in the development of technologies enabling autonomous systems has fostered the idea that autonomous vessels will soon be a reality. However, before the first autonomous vessel can be released into her actual context of operation, it is necessary to ensure that it is safe. This is a major challenge as the experience of autonomous ships is very limited. This study highlights the need for elaborating a systemic and systematic hazard analysis since the earliest design phase of an autonomous vessel. In particular, it proposes a process for elaborating an initial hazard analysis and management that provides coherent, transparent and traceable safety input information for the design of an autonomous vessel.

At the same time, however, the presence of embankments at one area influences hydraulic conditions of downstream areas located on the same river. These hydraulic interactions are often neglected in current flood risk management. The aim of this study is to explicitly acknowledge hydraulic interactions and investigate their impact on establishing optimal embankment heights along a stretch of the IJssel River. We find that the current approach leads to a single solution, while taking into account hydraulic interactions substantially expands the number of promising solutions. Furthermore, under a reference scenario, the current approach is in fact suboptimal with respect to both downstream locations and the system as a whole. Under uncertainty, it performs adequately from a system viewpoint, but poorly for individual locations, mostly due to risk overestimation downstream. Overall, the current approach proves to be too short-sighted, because spatial trade-offs among locations are neglected and alternative solutions remain hidden. Acknowledging the effect of hydraulic interactions provides policy makers with a broader and more comprehensive spectrum of flood risk management strategies. © 2019 The Authors.

Previous research on security risk management has mainly focused on using security measures to prevent intentional attacks, neglecting the effects of safety barriers. Safety barriers are able to reduce the potential consequences and decrease the attractiveness of chemical industrial parks to terrorists who aim to maximize the damage. From a systematic perspective, the potential consequence of intentional attacks is defined as the expected loss which is the sum-product of damage probability and consequence of installations. A consequence-based method including a Dynamic Vulnerability Assessment Graph (DVAG) model is proposed to integrate safety and security resources for reducing the risk of intentional attacks. The DVAG model is developed based on dynamic graphs, considering the effects of security measures, safety barriers, and emergency response. This method can assess the consequences and damage probabilities of possible intentional attacks so as to mitigate the risk via evaluation and allocation of security measures and safety barriers with fast computation speed. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Domino effects; Dynamic graphs; Safety barriers; Security measures; Security risk management,Risk assessment; Risk management; Terrorism; Domino effects; Dynamic graph; Safety barriers; Security measure; Security risk managements; Accident prevention,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064678241

In practice, a limited number of strategies are considered and interdependencies between interventions are often simplified. This paper presents the Multiple Lines of Defence Optimization System (MODOS)-model. This quick, probabilistic model simulates and evaluates the impact of many flood risk reduction strategies while accounting for interdependencies amongst measures. The simulation includes hydraulic calculations, damage calculations, and the effects of measures for various return periods. The application and potential of this model is shown with a conceptual and simplified case study, based on the Houston-Galveston Bay area. The analyses demonstrate how the MODOS-model identifies trade-offs within the system and shows how flood risk, cost, and impact respond to flood management decisions.

A Socio-political index is defined and embedded in an innovative and comprehensive assessment method, considering the effects of social, economic and political elements on pipeline attractiveness and vulnerability. After having analysed the security threats, security measures, aimed at increasing the security level of a pipeline system, are assessed by using a game-theory model. The pipeline segments which are the most probable to be attacked are determined. In addition, having assessed the possible outcomes of attacks to each segment, the security of different segments of specific pipeline routes can be further improved. Our approach can efficiently allocate limited security resources to decrease the security risk along a pipeline route. It should be noted that although this study focuses on oil and gas pipelines, the proposed methodology could be easily adapted to other pipeline systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,Gas pipelines; Piping systems; Risk assessment; Water pipelines; Comprehensive assessment; Game theory models; Oil-and-Gas pipelines; Pipe-line systems; Pipeline segments; Security measure; Security risk assessments; Security threats; Game theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046751786

This paper builds on the assumption that video games can be used as a stimulus for the experimental study of curiosity, and forms a basis in examining the type of curiosity motivated by spatial exploration. A video game was created that incorporates five proposed ‘game design patterns’ that may induce curiosity in players. The game, Shinobi Valley, was tested in a pilot study with 24 participants. Participants responded positively to the game and exhibited exploratory behaviour while playing without specifically being prompted to do so. The presented results suggest which of the patterns are most promising in inducing curiosity, and show that the game is of sufficient quality to be used in larger studies. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).",Affective game design; Design for curiosity; Game design; Game user research; Player motivation,Interactive computer graphics; Interactive computer systems; Motivation; Exploratory behaviours; Game design; Game user researches; Human actions; Pilot studies; Spatial explorations; Video game; Human computer interaction,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074829846

Measures to reduce risk should not only be based on the magnitude of physical hazard, but also on the exposure and vulnerability of communities. In this article, we examine flood risk management policies in the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten using coupled agent-based and flood models. The agent-based model is used to model actors' behaviour in relation to urban building development and policies that are designed to reduce flood hazard and communities' vulnerability and exposure. The policies considered in the model are a Beach Policy, a Building and Housing Ordinance, a Flood Zoning policy and hazard mitigation structural measures. The flood model is used to simulate coastal and pluvial floods on the island. Agent behaviour such as building new houses and implementing hazard reduction measures affect the flood model as these actions affect the rainfall-runoff process. The flood maps generated from the updated flood model simulations are then used to assess the impact and update agents’ attributes and behaviour. The simulations results show that low-lying areas are populated, which increases the exposure, and the number of vulnerable houses is also high. Hence, out of the four policies, implementing hazard reduction measures is the most important. Reducing the flood hazard by widening existing drainage channels, constructing new ones and building dykes as coastal flood defence would reduce the hazard, hence reducing the number of flooded houses. As it affects all households on the island, the Building and Housing Ordinance is an important policy to reduce vulnerability. In general, the coupled model outputs can be used to inform policy decision making and provide insights to policymakers on the island. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modelling; Flood risk management; Sint maarten; Small island development states; Socio-hydrology,rain; storm water; decision making; flood; flood control; flood damage; modeling; policy implementation; policy making; rainfall-runoff modeling; risk assessment; small island state; vulnerability; Article; building; catchment; climate; climate change; flooding; geography; hurricane; hydrology; risk management; runoff; Saint Martin (Dutch); sea level; sensitivity analysis; urban area; urbanization; city planning; disaster; risk management; Caribbean Islands; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Saint Martin; City Planning; Disasters; Floods; Risk Management; Sint Maarten,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85071709200

For the stock of Dutch non-profit housing associations it was agreed to improve the average energy performance to an average energy index of 1.40 in 2020. This research assesses and gives insights in the progress to this objective for over 2.0 million dwellings of over 250 Dutch non-profit housing associations in 2017 and 2018. The assessment consists of an analysis of applied renovation measures, changes of the stock like new construction and demolishing, and clarifying characteristics of housing associations. It is concluded that large urban housing associations with adequate financial positions drive the improvement of the average sectoral energy performance. The improvement happens for a large part within the existing stock, mostly with traditional improvements like improved heating installations and improved insulation. Innovative solutions like: photovoltaic solar systems, combined heat and power systems, biomass systems, heat pumps and external heating, are responsible for a relative small part of the improvement within renovations. New construction and demolishing are also responsible for a relative small part of the annual improvement, but there is potential to improve this. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Therefore, this study empirically elaborates on the application of three classic tools of governance networks, analyzing how leaders of local government and village communities influence the effectiveness of these tools. The data were collected by snowball interviews, careful observations, and documentary analysis in Xiaonan village, a representatively successful case of rural-village governance networks in China. We detected that governance tools are often inadequately used and under-development in Chinese rural-village governance networks, accompanying a strong interaction between the effectiveness of tools and leadership.

We express these two different emphases as two archetypical narratives and use those to illustrate that some political decision-making factors should be taken seriously by critiquing some of the core ‘techno-optimist’ tenets from a more ‘policy-pessimist’ angle. In the conclusion we have these two narratives meet ‘eye-to-eye’, facilitating a more systematized interrogation of big data promises and shortcomings in further research, paying appropriate attention to both technical-rational and political decision-making factors. We finish by offering a realist rejoinder of these two narratives, allowing for more context-specific scrutiny and balancing both technical-rational and political decision-making concerns, resulting in more realistic expectations about using big data for policymaking in practice. © 2019 The Authors",Analytics; Big data; Decision-making; Government; Network governance; Policy-making; Public administration; Science-policy interface,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066408388

A SMS provides confidence to diverse stakeholders that organizational safety is at an appropriate level and fulfils the applicable regulatory standards. As a multifaceted system for organizational safety assessment, ensurance and assurance, the evaluation of the design and operational use of SMS is a complex process. An evaluation needs to provide evidence about how well the design and operation of an SMS complies with applicable standards and how well the methods used in the SMS implementation support the organizational policies and practical work. In the maritime domain, SMS is broadly applied. However, there are few theoretically rooted SMS design approaches, and there is a lack of frameworks to evaluate how well the SMS is designed and how effectively it operates. This paper proposes an initial evaluation framework for the design and operational use of a maritime SMS design approach based on Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP), realist evaluation and Bayesian Networks. This framework is applied for a case study of vessel traffic services (VTS) Finland to test its relevance and ability to guide the SMS design. The experiences gained in the case study, and the related discussion on the framework, can guide further research in this area. Ultimately, the work can be used as a basis for developing maritime SMS auditing processes, based on specific theoretical and methodological approaches. © 2019, The Author(s).",Evaluation framework; Maritime safety; Safety management system; Systems-Theoretic Accident Model and Processes (STAMP); Vessel traffic services,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074708331

Past research has focused on the use and added value of PSS. While earlier studies have widely acknowledged the importance of context in determining the effectiveness of PSS, there has so far been no dedicated study of the influence of context on the use and added value of these tools in real planning workshops. To address this gap, we made an in-depth exploratory case study of a PSS, called the Adaptation Support Tool (AST), used in an adaptation planning workshop in Guayaquil, Ecuador. The workshop used the AST to support collaborative spatial planning for urban water management, at the neighbourhood scale. Interviews, questionnaires, observations and document review were used to investigate the influence of three contextual factors on the use and added value of the AST. The studied contextual factors are: 1) the style of tool use, 2) the phase of planning, and 3) the local project setting. Our findings indicate that the style of tool use and the local project setting were the most important contextual factors in determining the use and added value of the AST during the workshop. Meanwhile, the phase of planning appears to be critical for achieving impacts at the project level. This exploratory case study is a modest first contribution to understanding the influence of context on the use and added value of PSS in practice. Nevertheless, the findings indicate that further exploration of this topic could offer important insights to PSS use in practice.

This conventional valuation approach has been criticized for not valuing positive and negative impacts of transport projects in relation to each other and for not valuing such impacts in a public context, but in the context of private decisions. These critiques might be circumvented through valuing transport projects in a social choice context in which overall burdens and benefits of proposed transport projects are considered together in a public context. We investigate the extent to which a social choice valuation approach produces different outcomes than a conventional valuation approach. We conducted four social choice valuation experiments in which respondents were asked to choose between alternatives for a new road, trading off travel time and three environmental impacts (noise, recreation and biodiversity). Our findings suggest that, under social choice valuation, individuals assign substantially more value to environmental impacts than travel time as compared to conventional valuation studies. Moreover, in a social choice setting, respondents assigned monetary values to impacts that are not (or only qualitatively) considered in conventional CBAs of transport projects. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Biodiversity; Cost-benefit analysis; Environmental valuation; Noise; Recreation; Social choice valuation; Transport appraisal; Transport policy; Travel time,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067070355

Many of these climate targets focus on the transition of the energy system which has led to the development of various energy transition scenarios. Now that fossil resources are being replaced by non-combustible and renewable energy sources a re-assessment of the applicability of the current set of metrics on which these energy scenarios are based is necessary. Now that energy derived from renewable and non-combustible resources with abundant availability but limited instantaneous availability becomes more prominent the ongoing electrification of the energy system combined with the decarbonisation of the electricity system has caused the current set of energy scenario metrics to become ambiguous. More specifically we show that Total Primary Energy (TPE) and its related indicators, Energy Efficiency (EE), Energy Intensity (EI) as well as the key metric Electricity Generation Capacity (EGC) have become unrepresentative, potentially misleading and for a large part irrelevant. This is problematic as these metrics steer climate policy and investment decisions based on statistical artefacts rather than valid representation of the energy system. This study concludes with a set of requirements on energy scenarios to overcome these problems that will lead energy scenarios to focus on Total Final Consumption within a mix of related energy metrics. © 2019 The Authors",Decarbonisation; Electrification; Energy metrics; Energy transition,Decarbonization; Electric utilities; Energy efficiency; Investments; Decarbonisation; Electricity generation capacity; Electrification; Energy metrics; Energy transitions; Fundamental building blocks; Instantaneous availabilities; International climate agreements; Renewable energy resources,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065731474

The purpose of this paper is to explore the blockchain technology diffusion in different industries through a combination of academic literature and social media (Twitter). Design/methodology/approach: The insights derived from the academic literature and social media have been used to classify industries into five stages of the innovation-decision process, namely, knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation and confirmation (Rogers, 1995). Findings: Blockchain is found to be diffused in almost all industries, but the level of diffusion varies. The analysis highlights that manufacturing industry is at the knowledge stage. Further public administration is at persuasion stage. Subsequently, transportation, communications, electric, gas and sanitary services and trading industry had reached to the decision stage. Then, services industries have reached to implementation stage while finance, insurance and real estate industries are the innovators of blockchain technologies and have reached the confirmation stage of innovation-decision process. Practical implications: Actual implementations of blockchain technology are still in its infancy stage for most of the industries. The findings suggest that specific industries are developing specific blockchain applications. Originality/value: To the best of the authors’ knowledge this is the first study which is using social media data for investigating the diffusion of blockchain in industries. The results show that the combination of Twitter and academic literature analysis gives better insights into diffusion than a single data source. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Blockchain; Diffusion of innovation; Social media analytics; Systematic literature review; Technology adoption,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068748636

Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent of how the cities or local governments can cope with the challenges of the current transport sector climate change mitigation in Bandung City. This paper aims to assess the governance context of climate policies in Bandung City and support further co-benefits. The preliminary stage of study shows that the policies in reducing GHG emissions are not in accordance with what was written by the government. The provincial and local government was aware that the stipulation delivered by the central government regarding mitigation on climate change stated in the regulation both in provincial and local level. Based on the actor's characteristic, the policies that encourage to reduce GHG emissions drive as a multi-actor interaction process namely The Paratransit, Trans Metro Bandung (TMB) and Vehicle Emissions Test. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The analytical framework used for this analysis is the Governance Assessment Tool and the co-benefits approach. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, and secondary quantitative data. The results reveal that the governance qualities create a context that there still are some limits, although several improvements have shown the positive trend at the local level. This is due to the qualities of the extent aspect as a low to moderate, the flexibility as a restrictive, and the coherence and intensity as moderate. The assessment of the criteria of co-benefits is more relevant to the public transport. The TMB has met all of the criteria of co-benefits. Thus, this TMB program has the highest impact to attain the co-benefits. The paratransit has the positive value of the criteria for lowering GHG emissions, energy and environmental sustainability, and development goals. The vehicle emission test met the criteria of sustainability and technical feasibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Developing countries; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Sustainable development; Central government; Climate change mitigation; Empirical case studies; Environmental sustainability; Interaction process; Semi structured interviews; Transport sectors; Vehicle emission test; Climate change,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070997725

Construction practices consume large amounts of materials, resources and energy. Sustainability and CE could play a big role in reduction efforts. However, the potential influence of both concepts on the planning and construction of large infrastructures remains unexplored. This paper investigates how professionals involved in a high-speed railway station project in the Chinese city of Jingmen envision the use of sustainability and CE for the planning and construction of the railway station and its surrounding areas. We reviewed policy documents and interviewed local professionals with the Triple Bottom Line (TBL) framework. The analysis reveals opportunities for improvement towards sustainability and the interdependence between the dimensions in the TBL framework for the railway station and its surroundings. The case shows that local professionals identify ample opportunities for improvement (presented as ""sustainability ideas""), but none appear truly sustainable. These insights provide evidence that the hierarchical introduction of transition(s) creates a cognitive silo for local professionals when envisioning sustainability ideas. In the TBL framework, this study finds a useful and novel approach to break down the silos, because the TBL stresses the interdependence between the various sustainability dimensions. © 2019 by the authors.",China; Circular Economy (CE); Jingmen; Railway station; Sustainability; Transport infrastructure; Triple Bottom Line (TBL),economic development; high-speed train; infrastructural development; infrastructure planning; navigation; railway construction; railway transport; sustainability; sustainable development; China; Hubei; Jingmen,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070445418

Demand response has gained significant attention as a means to cope with uncertainty of renewable energy sources. Demand response of residential and service sector consumers, when accumulated and managed by aggregators, can play a role in existing electricity markets. This paper addresses the question to what extent aggregator-mediated demand response can be used to deal with the impacts of the uncertainty of solar generation. Uncertain solar generation leads to imbalances of an aggregator. These imbalances can be reduced by shifting flexible loads, which is called demand response for internal balancing. The aim of this paper is to assess the impact of demand response from loads in residential and service sectors for internal balancing to reduce the imbalances of an aggregator, caused by uncertain solar generation. For this purpose, a Model Predictive Control model which minimizes the imbalances of the aggregator through load shifting is presented. The model is applied to a realistic case study in the Netherlands. The results show that demand response for internal balancing succeeds in reducing imbalances. Even though this is favorable from the power system's perspective, economic analysis shows that the aggregator is not financially incentivized to implement demand response for internal balancing. © 2019 The Authors",Aggregator; Demand response; Electricity markets; Model Predictive Control; Solar uncertainty,Commerce; Energy policy; Housing; Model predictive control; Natural resources; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Aggregator; Demand response; Electricity supply and demands; Reliable operation; Renewable energy source; Service sectors; Solar generation; Solar uncertainty; Economic analysis; alternative energy; control system; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy market; equipment; operations technology; power generation; solar power; uncertainty analysis; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064445518

Although such normative conflicts are key to sustainability transitions, attention to such conflicts is lacking in transition studies. In this paper we understand societal conflict as an informal assessment of sustainable transition pathways with the potential for learning about normative ideas about the direction, speed and means of transitions. We analyse the Dutch societal conflict on the plans for shale gas exploration between 2010 and 2013, based on a media-analysis and interviews, in order to identify the normative conflicts and to find out to which extent these normative conflicts resulted in higher-order learning. The two main normative conflicts in the case firstly concern the role of gas in the energy transition, and secondly the balance between local and national interests in defining the public interest. With that, the societal conflict challenges two key elements of the Dutch welfare state. We conclude that there has been higher-order learning as regards the first conflict, but not as regards the second. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Controversy; Learning; Normative conflict; Shale gas; Societal conflict; Sustainability transitions,Geological surveys; Shale gas; Sustainable development; Controversy; Learning; Normative conflict; Societal conflict; Sustainability transition; Shale; hydrocarbon exploration; learning; shale gas; social conflict; sustainable development; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019150333

Strategic delta plans outline a long-term vision to be embedded into the plans and activities of government agencies and semi-public actors at multiple levels. This implies a form of coordinated, yet decentralized, implementation. Although, its importance is widely acknowledged, there are few analytical approaches to assess the feasibility and possible bottlenecks of such implementation processes. This article applies a motivation and ability (MOTA) framework to assess the implementation feasibility of the Mekong Delta Plan in Ben Tre province, Vietnam. The results reveal diverging motivations and a perceived lack of ability among government actors at local and regional level. When not well-managed, this could hamper the translation of the strategic goals and visions into local and regional actions. This suggests the usefulness of the MOTA framework as a tool to help manage implementation processes for strategic delta planning. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This paper proposes a novel framework for Participatory Sustainable Agricultural Development (PSAD) that distinguishes four main classes of factors that influence participation in SAD: environmental, economic, social and governance-related. The factors in each of these classes are analysed in relation to their effect over time, on the basis of 49 SAD programmes reported in the literature. Findings show that the social factors of engagement and empowerment, not often addressed in existing SAD programmes, are of significant influence to effect over time, as are the environmental factors of food safety, and the economic factors of production and capacity development. As such this paper shows that in in addition to the well-acknowledged need for knowledge and skills related to food safety, production and capacity development, SAD programmes also need to address the social factors of engagement and empowerment to enable sustainable change over time for SAD through participation. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Purchasing portfolio matrix (PPM) is a segmentation method that considers two dimensions (profit impact and supply risk) against which the materials purchased by the company are classified. Despite its popularity, PPM has been the subject of serious criticism. A new approach to supplier segmentation, called supplier potential matrix (SPM), aims to fulfil the need for a unifying framework that includes all the important variables under two overarching dimensions: supplier capabilities and supplier willingness. While the focus of PPM is on supply, SPM mainly focuses on relationship. However, it is important to include both the supplies and the relationship with those who supply, the suppliers. The main purpose of this study is to bring these two approaches together through a hybrid matrix called PPM-SPM. Data is collected from a company working with 70 suppliers. Best worst method (BWM), is used to determine the weights of the criteria we need for the two segmentation approaches. The suppliers are segmented based on the two approaches. A combined PPM-SPM segmentation is then proposed and discussed. The results show that the combined approach improves supplier management. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The paper aims to filter a list of key learnings on urban living labs through the lens of Responsible Research and Innovation (RRI). One of the motivations is that key learnings on urban living labs are mainly derived from means-goal effectiveness (MGE) thinking while the urban setting calls for a broader perspective due to complexity and tension from the multi-actor, multifunctional, and multi-scalar character of cities. The filtering reveals almost 40 learnings as 'overlap' and 'exclusive for MGE'. Importantly, five learnings are identified as specific for RRI and potentially enriching living lab methodology: ethical and normative principles like health, safety, security, and equality between societal groups, and a wider distribution of benefits and risks of living lab outcomes, in particular, contradictory sustainability issues. The RRI filtering causes three practical implications: coping with uneven power distribution between stakeholders, limited feasibility of applying the comprehensive learning framework, and challenges of overarching platform structures enabling to better incorporate RRI concerns in living lab methodology. The findings as presented in an adapted list are new, as RRI values and concerns have seldom been applied to practical innovation and have never been explicitly applied to urban living labs' performance beyond the borders of effectiveness thinking. © 2019 by the authors.",Filtering; Means-goal effectiveness; Responsible research and innovation; Sustainability; Urban living labs,feasibility study; filter; innovation; laboratory method; learning; participatory approach; performance assessment; social behavior; stakeholder; urban area,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85073911679

A popular method to account for residential self-selection is by including people's attitudes towards various modes as additional control variables in the regression. Yet, while attitudes may indeed influence both residential location choice and travel behavior, they may, in turn, also be affected by these factors. This paper aims to assess to what extent the built environment and travel behavior influence people's stated reasons for living in a certain location over time, which would mean that these reasons are actually endogenous to the built environment and travel behavior. To achieve this aim panel data are used from the same respondents (who did not move house)asking them at two points in time (two years apart)to state their reasons for their current residential choice. The data are modeled using a latent transition model. The results indicate that approximately 39% of the Dutch population belongs to a class which attaches importance to short distances to public transport and shops. Moreover, the distance to the train station, the amount of travel by train and car ownership at the first point in time are found to influence the probability that a person (still)belongs to this class at the second point in time, providing evidence that the built environment and travel behavior temporally precede travel related residential preferences. The results suggest that the use of stated reasons for residential choice as control variables is problematic. © 2019 Hong Kong Society for Transportation Studies",Attitudes; Built environment; Residential self-selection; Travel behavior,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85065514749

Internationalization of young high-tech firms is strongly required given the drive for upscaling technology solutions and given the increased global spread of knowledge centers. To increase understanding, a framework of conditions of capability formation in internationalization is developed and measured using a sample of 105 university spin-off firms in Northwest Europe. In early years, 62% of these firms employed knowledge relationships abroad, often crossing continents. The main capabilities in this stage tend to be connected to education (PhD) and market training, innovation activity at practical level, and diversity in preceding domestic networks. Subsequent changes on the firm level show a somewhat stronger internationalization, 74%, associated with other capabilities compared to early years, mainly derived in previous internationalization, pre-start work experience and innovation activity at an advanced level. However, the results also point to a ‘problematic’ segment of firms, including shrinking patterns and persistent absence of internationalization.

However, the sheer volume of import declarations lodged annually makes it impossible to manually cross-validate each declaration. Smart contracts have the potential to automatically aggregate relevant information from blockchain-based ledgers for lodging and cross-validation. In this paper we explore how such smart contract could be implemented. We demonstrate that a smart import declaration can be used to automatically aggregate information from different sources (e.g., pro forma invoice data elements stored on the blockchain ledger). However, technical and organizational considerations that are inherent to blockchain technology need to be addressed for the smart import declaration to be acceptable for both customs authorities and declarants. It is therefore suggested that future work focusses on data standards required to enable automatic aggregation of relevant trade information and the generation of the import declaration and governance of the smart import declaration by customs authorities to assure correctness. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Blockchain technology; Cross-validation; E-customs; International shipping; Smart contract; Smart import declaration,Aggregates; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Ships; Automatic aggregations; Cross validation; Data elements; Data standards; E-custom; International shippings; Smart import declaration; Blockchain,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068607328

Some governments have introduced the role of Chief Information Officer (CIO) to facilitate these innovations though adoption of new technologies. The traditional CIO role of improving operational efficiency is now shifting towards exploring new IT-enabled opportunities required in digital transformation. In this context, CIO capabilities are expanding to be more involved in administrative processes and digital transformation, however, their organizational role seem to lag behind. This paper is aimed at evaluating the current role of CIOs and to provide policy recommendations to strengthen their role. Data was collected during a session in which roles and capabilities of CIOs were discussed. In particular, we found that often the CIO was positioned as having an IT role, whereas a more organizational role was needed. CIOs should develop capabilities to support digital transformation and to develop architecture that is adaptive and agile.

It identifies where standardisation helps to improve intermodal transport, who is active in intermodal transport standardisation, what types of standards are needed and what the decision-making process and implementation of standards should be like to positively influence the performance of intermodal transportation. Design/methodology/approach: An empirical study is designed to carry out this research project. The empirical study starts with a review of the organisations that are responsible for standardisation and intermodal transport, together with the standards that they have developed, and are developing, so far. It continues with analysing the topics where standardisation helps to improve the performance of intermodal transport. The analysis is based on 12 interviews, followed by desk research, to validate the respondents’ statements. Findings: The results show that intermodal transportation should be distinguished in continental and maritime transport, which require different standards. In maritime transport, the hardware aspects of the system are highly standardised. However, further standardisation of information exchange offers potential to improve the quality of transport. For continental transport, challenges appear in the heterogeneity of infrastructure and loading units used in Europe. For both systems, openness and consensus are main requirements for the development of successful standards. Originality/value: Standards facilitate interoperability, quality and safety of intermodal transportation, which leads to better performance. This has drawn little attention in the literature.

Such information can be used to determine whether transported goods might be suspicious and therefore require physical inspection. Although businesses are obliged to report some information, they are reluctant to share additional information for fear of sharing competitively sensitive information, becoming liable and not being compliant with the law. These reasons are often overlooked in the design of software architectures for information sharing. In the present research, we followed a design science approach to develop a software architecture for business-to-government information sharing. Based on literature and a case study, we elicited the requirements an architecture that provides for the sharing of information should meet to make it acceptable to businesses. We then developed the architecture and evaluated it against the requirements. The architecture consists of a blockchain that stores events and rules for information sharing that are controlled by businesses. For each event, two parties use their private keys to encrypt its Merkle root to confirm that they know the data are correct. This makes it easy to check whether information is reliable and whether an event should be accepted. Access control, metadata and context information enable the context-based sharing of information. This is combined with the encryption and decryption of data to provide access to certain data within an organisation. © 2017, The Author(s).",Access control; Blockchain; Business rules; Customs; Encryption; ICT architecture; Information sharing; Safety; Security; Software architecture; Supply chain; Willingness,Access control; Accident prevention; Blockchain; Cryptography; Information analysis; Software architecture; Supply chains; Business rules; Customs; ICT architecture; Information sharing; Security; Willingness; Information dissemination,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026899339

The use of IoT might yield many benefits for organizations engaged in civil infrastructure management, but these benefits might be difficult to realize as organizations are not equipped to handle and interpret this data. The purpose of this paper is to understand how IoT adoption affects decision-making processes. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper the changes in the business processes for managing civil infrastructure assets brought about by IoT adoption are analyzed by investigating two case studies within the water management domain. Propositions for effective IoT adoption in decision-making processes are derived. Findings: The results show that decision processes in civil infrastructure asset management have been transformed to deal with the real-time nature of the data. The authors found the need to make organizational and business process changes, development of new capabilities, data provenance and governance and the need for standardization. IoT can have a transformative effect on business processes. Research limitations/implications: Because of the chosen research approach, the research results may lack generalizability. Therefore, researchers are encouraged to test the propositions further.

As a result, roll-out planning generally takes a corridor approach. However, with higher penetration of electric vehicles in urban areas, cities contemplate whether inner-city fast chargers can be an alternative for the growing amount of slow public chargers. For this purpose, more knowledge is required in motives and preferences of users and actual usage patterns of fast chargers. Similarly, with increasing charging speeds of fast chargers and different modes (taxi, car sharing) also switching to electric vehicles, the effect of charging speed should be evaluated as well as preferences amongst different user groups. This research investigates the different intentions and motivations of EV drivers at fast charging stations to see how charging behaviour at such stations differs using both data analysis from charging stations as a survey among EV drivers. Additionally, it estimates the willingness of EV drivers to use fast charging as a substitute for on-street home charging given higher charging speeds. The paper concludes that limited charging speeds imply that EV drivers prefer parking and charging over fast charging but this could change if battery developments allow higher charging speeds. © 2019 by the authors.",Choice experiment; Electric vehicles; Fast charging; Level 2 charging; Public charging; Survey,Behavioral research; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Mobile telecommunication systems; Speed; Surveying; Surveys; Taxicabs; Urban planning; Actual usage patterns; Battery development; Charging station; Choice experiments; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Fast charging; Fast charging stations; Level 2; Charging (batteries),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85074915670

An alternative is to prevent new customers from installing solar PV systems, but this is against the common goal of increasing renewable energy generation. This paper demonstrates that solar PV curtailment in low voltage areas can be reduced and fairly distributed among PV owners by centrally coordinating the operation of PV inverters. The optimal inverter active and reactive power operation points are computed by solving a multi-objective optimization problem with a fairness objective. The main results show that fair optimal inverter dispatch (FOID) results in less power curtailment than passive voltage regulation based on Volt/VAr droop control, especially at high solar PV to load ratios. The effectiveness of the model is demonstrated on a residential low voltage network. © 2019 IEEE.",Curtailment fairness; Distribution networks; Inverter control; PV hosting capacity; Voltage regulation,Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Investments; Multiobjective optimization; Renewable energy resources; Voltage control; Voltage regulators; Active and Reactive Power; Control technologies; Curtailment fairness; Hosting capacity; Inverter control; Multi-objective optimization problem; Renewable energy generation; Solar photovoltaics; Solar power generation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072332624

Biojet fuel is expected to make an essential contribution to the decarbonization of the aviation sector. Brazil is seen as a key player in developing sustainable aviation biofuels owing to its long-standing experience with biofuels. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of what policies may be conducive to the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain is lacking. We extended a spatially explicit agent-based model to explore the emergence of a biojet fuel supply chain from the existing sugarcane–ethanol supply chain. The model accounts for new policies (feed-in tariff and capital investment subsidy) and new considerations into the decision making about production and investment in processing capacity. We found that in a tax-free gasoline regime, a feed-in tariff above 3 R$/L stimulates the production of biojet fuel. At higher levels of gasoline taxation (i.e., 2.46 R$/L), however, any feed-in tariff is insufficient to ensure the production of biojet fuel. Thus, at these levels of gasoline taxation, it is needed to introduce regulations on the production of biojet fuel to ensure its production. Given the current debate about the future direction of the biofuel policy in Brazil, we recommend further research into the effect of market mechanisms based on greenhouse gas emissions on the emergence of a Brazilian biojet fuel supply chain. © 2019 The Authors.

The study focuses on selected metropolitan areas in Europe, Australia, and Canada, and employs Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). QCA can handle multiple explanatory conditions in combination, framing the relationship between conditions and studied outcomes in terms of necessity and sufficiency. The paper reveals three alternative combinations of organisational elements that are sufficient for achieving each outcome, underscoring that modal split and cost-recovery depend on the combined effects of multiple conditions (conjunctural causality), and that different paths can lead to similar results (equifinality). Furthermore, even though both outcomes are linked to higher usage of public transport, findings suggest that each of them might require decision-makers to give attention to different elements. Higher modal split is closely linked to both integration between land-use and transport, and the integration of planning responsibilities within an authority at the regional/metropolitan level. Higher cost-recovery, in turn, requires focus on the way agency over funding and risk allocation strategies shape incentives for savings and/or revenue generation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA); Metropolitan public transport; Public transport governance; Public transport performance,Benchmarking; Decision making; Depreciation; Economics; Integration; Land use; Motor transportation; Recovery; Fuzzy Set Qualitative Comparative Analysis; Key performance indicators; Land use and transports; Metropolitan area; Public transport; Public transport systems; Qualitative comparative analysis; Revenue generation; Public risks; comparative study; governance approach; land use planning; metropolitan area; organizational framework; performance assessment; public transport; strategic approach; transportation planning; transportation system; Australia; Canada; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85064845387

As companies tend to outsource a variety of their activities, green supplier selection as an imperative function of green supply chain management, has a crucial role in helping companies to maintain their strategic competitiveness. Despite the plethora of studies introducing supplier selection models based on economic criteria, studies that take into account the environmental issues are rather limited. In this study, a comprehensive grey-based green supplier selection model is proposed that incorporates both economic and environmental criteria. A novel weight assignment model is proposed by combining best-worst method and fuzzy grey cognitive maps to capture the interdependencies among the criteria. Improved grey relational analysis is advanced to be able to use grey weights of criteria to evaluate green suppliers which are subsequently ranked using an interval analysis approach. This study contributes to the decision-making theory by addressing the shortcomings of the available green supplier selection models. A real-world case study is also presented to show the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed model. The results of this study proved the proposed comprehensive model to be well capable of addressing the green supplier selection problem by taking in to account the interdependencies between criteria as well as the uncertainties associated with experts’ judgments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Best-worst method; Cognitive maps; Green supplier selection; Grey relational analysis,Cognitive systems; Decision making; Decision theory; Environmental protection; Best-worst method; Cognitive maps; Decision-making theories; Fuzzy grey cognitive maps; Green supplier selections; Green supply chain management; Grey relational analysis; Uncertain environments; Supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063112944

Here, we demonstrate the application of anticipatory Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) on novel anti-reflective coatings used for greenhouses in the Netherlands. Currently, these coating technologies are developed at the laboratory scale (lab-scale), but they have the potential to be transferred to commercial scale on the short term. What-if scenarios have been used to scale-up the coating production process to pilot and industrial scales. The scenarios were developed by optimizing the laboratory scale coating production parameters. A cradle-to-grave LCA has been done to compare novel coatings with conventional coatings. The functional unit has been defined as the production of 1692.30 kg of tomatoes in greenhouses during 30 years. Results indicate that the novel coating manufactured at industrial scale can compete with conventional coatings in terms of the environmental performance. Furthermore, LCA shows that the novel coating assessed does not bring environmental benefits as compared to employing uncoated glass. However, the use of the glass coating in the greenhouse may bring economic benefits during functional lifetime by means of increased yield of crop (e.g. tomatoes). Different pathways of the technological development of the novel coating have been considered in the sensitivity analysis. The option that includes glass manufacturing in the Netherlands rather than China has led to the best environmental impact results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Anti-reflective coating; Anticipatory LCA; Dip coating; Greenhouse glass; Scale-up; Scenarios,Antireflection coatings; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Fruits; Glass; Greenhouses; Life cycle; Reflective coatings; Sensitivity analysis; Sol-gels; Anti reflective coatings; Anticipatory LCA; Dip coating; Scale-up; Scenarios; Environmental impact,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063112609

Given the low usage rated of the BSS, we distributed a survey in all stations. 134 users answered the questionnaire. We clustered the potentially relevant factors in five dimensions: Socio-cultural, Economic, Infrastructure, System function and Environmental. We eliminated the Environmental dimension because of invalid loading factors. Next, we evaluated the importance and significance of these factors and the four remaining dimensions for the acceptance of BSS in Mashhad. Furthermore, MANOVA was used to evaluate the relationship between the demographic characteristics and dimensions. The findings indicate that the system is mainly used by young people, students, people with a low-income and those without a vehicle. The results of the evaluations show that all four dimensions are effective, the impact of the Economic dimension being less important than the three other dimensions. The most important factors are the authorities’ use of the system and driving behavior (Socio-cultural dimension), easy use and registration, and proper and timely maintenance (System function) and the availability of bike lanes and suitable bike equipment (Infrastructure). This study is the first attempt to investigate different factors and dimensions important for BSS acceptability in Iran. It can be said that the factors affecting the acceptability of BSS is different in different contexts. Nevertheless, we expect our results to be useful for the design and implementation of BSSs in other cities in Iran, and likely also in other developing countries. © 2019 World Conference on Transport Research Society",Acceptability; Bicycle sharing; Iran,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85062651053

Stakeholders advocate regional governance for the European grid expansion, which may evolve into a pan-European governance and is key to developing integrated, hybrid offshore projects. However, such projects are still scarce. We thus analyze the governance of the North Sea offshore grid expansion using the dimensions of level, implementation obligation, and implementation discretion. Our exploratory approach identifies five challenges. The challenges relate to 1) the interaction of the European and regional levels; 2) the interaction of the national and regional levels; 3) the participation of non-European Union countries; 4) the dependence of regional planning on national development plans, which consider national interests; and 5) the interaction of cost allocation and European financing for Projects of Common Interest. The recent Clean Energy Package proposal extensively reforms the regulation of the European power system. The Package is part of the Energy Union strategy and focuses on the energy and climate policies’ governance and the power system operation. Thus, regional governance of offshore expansion is largely unaltered, and our identified challenges remain unaddressed. © 2019 The Authors",Expansion planning; Governance; Offshore grid; Regional cooperation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061563995

Our systematic literature review (SLR) reveals that EA is a broad concept that is interpreted and used in many different ways. This breadth can be explained by the various starting points taken, and by the content-dependent nature of many EA efforts. Unsurprisingly, the literature presents diverse views on value creation and locates the value of EA in a broad range of areas. Only half of the articles provide empirical evidence supporting the EA value claims. Frequently, values are assumed to be the result of EA efforts, but many alternative explanations are possible. Based on the SLR findings, we identify EA myths that are attributable to an overly simplistic conceptualization of EA. These myths have their basis in the claim that EA is an instrument that can solve almost any kind of enterprise problem. This fails to acknowledge that EA in itself often does not provide value, but is an instrument enabling the creation of value. Based on our findings, we recommend demystifying EA by analysing the context-dependent mechanisms behind EA that result in value creation and developing rigorous evidence-based approaches to better understand EA. © 2018 The Authors",Enterprise architecture; Information architecture; IT architecture; Systematic literature review; Value,Computer networks; Enterprise Architecture; Information architectures; IT architecture; Systematic literature review; Value; Information management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057011347

The spatial layout of ATES systems is a key aspect for the technology, as thermal interactions between neighboring systems can degrade system performance. In light of this issue, current planning policies for ATES aim to avoid thermal interactions; however, under such policies, some urban areas already lack space for the further development of ATES, limiting achievable energy savings. We show how information exchange between ATES systems can support the dynamic management of thermal interactions, so that a significantly denser layout can be applied to increase energy savings in a given area without affecting system performance. To illustrate this approach, we simulate a distributed control framework across a range of scenarios for spatial planning and ATES operation in the city center of Utrecht, in The Netherlands. The results indicate that the dynamic management of thermal interactions can improve specific greenhouse gas savings by up to 40% per unit of allocated subsurface volume, for an equivalent level of ATES economic performance. However, taking advantage of this approach will require revised spatial planning policies to allow a denser development of ATES in urban areas. © 2019",Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES); Distributed energy management; Distributed probabilistic energy management; Distributed stochastic model predictive control; Large-scale seasonal energy storage,Aquifers; Distributed parameter control systems; Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy management; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Information management; Model predictive control; Stochastic control systems; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Storage management; Thermal energy; Urban planning; Aquifer thermal energy storage; Building technologies; Distributed control; Distributed energies; Economic performance; Information exchanges; Seasonal energy storages; Thermal interaction; Smart power grids; aquifer; building; energy efficiency; energy planning; energy storage; geothermal energy; greenhouse gas; probability; seasonality; smart grid; spatial planning; stochasticity; technological development; Netherlands; Utrecht [Netherlands],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063063246

Initiatives in this direction, captured under the umbrella-term ‘crowd-based innovations’ (CBI), offer novel opportunities in all domains of society by increasing the access, reach and speed of services and goods. At the same time, they signify important challenges because these innovations occur in a context of traditional, well-established institutional arrangements. CBI create an ‘institutional void’: existing rules, standards and practices are challenged and renegotiated. This raises questions about the safeguarding of public values such as quality, legitimacy, efficiency and governance of crowd-based innovations. The objective of this perspective piece is to present an interdisciplinary research agenda to address normative challenges for governing CBI. We will argue that such an agenda needs an integrated empirical-normative approach.

In sedimentary environments, such port developments can have adverse impacts on the evolution of adjacent coastlines. To learn from past port engineering practice, we created a unique database containing the coastline evolution and characteristics of 130 existing African seaports. Whereas the systematic mapping of coastal impacts was previously hampered by data availability, innovative automated satellite image processing techniques have enabled us to intercompare ports at an unprecedented continental scale. We found large geographical differences with respect to the beach evolution. The total detected changes in the beach area between 1984 and 2018 totaled 44 km2, of which ca. 23 km2 is accretion and ca. 21 km2 is erosion. The top 10% ""hotspot"" ports account for more than 65% of these changes. These hotspots exhibit common characteristics, namely: they are located on open coastlines, have large alongshore sediment transport potential, and have large cross-shore breakwaters. Although these driving characteristics are well established in coastal engineering theory, our results indicate that the beaches adjacent to the existing seaports have been and remain seriously affected by these drivers. Our results can be used to inform beach maintenance strategies for existing seaports and to support planners and engineers to minimize long-term coastal impacts of port expansions and new port developments in Africa in the future. © 2019 by the authors.",Coastal erosion; Coastline dynamics; Port design; Satellite imagery; Sediment transport; Sustainable ports,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066425103

As shippers preferences will vary widely, it is important to consider these variations between users in the design of service networks. Up to now, network design research has ignored the combined use of time and reliability valuations for heterogeneous user populations. The objective of this paper is to address these attributes in a model for freight service network design targeting service performance improvement. We present a new frequency based service network design model with transshipments, capacity constraints and heterogeneous users. We apply the model to demonstrate that including heterogeneity explicitly in network design pays off in terms of an improved user performance of the network. A case study is conducted for a railway network in China. Values of time and reliability are estimated from a recent Stated Preference survey and used to determine distinct user classes. The proposed optimization problem is solved using an improved Simulated Annealing based heuristic method, for the case of the aggregate user group and the case of two distinct classes. Results show that by taking variations in shippers’ VOT and VOR into account, users’ total generalized cost is reduced while service levels improve. We conclude that incorporating heterogeneous VOT and VOR into the service network design problem is of interest for decisions on network investments. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Freight service network design; Heterogeneous preferences; Value of reliability; Value of time,freight transport; heterogeneity; network design; railway transport; reliability analysis; shipping; travel time; valuation; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85067933795

This implies that opinion-shifts over time are not always taken into consideration by decision makers relying on these polls. Observations have given the impression that public acceptability of energy projects increases after implementation. However, this positive shift over time has not yet been systematically studied and is not yet understood very well. This paper aims to fill this gap. Based on two psychological mechanisms, loss aversion and cognitive dissonance reduction, we hypothesize that specifically people who live in proximity of a risky low-carbon technology-a hydrogen fuel station (HFS) in this case-evaluate this technology as more positive after its implementation than before. We conducted a survey among Dutch citizen living nearby a HFS and indeed found a positive shift in the overall evaluation of HFS after implementation. We also found that the benefits weighed stronger and the risks weaker after the implementation. This shift did not occur for citizens living further away from the HFS. The perceived risks and benefits did not significantly change after implementation, neither for citizens living in proximity, nor for citizens living further away.

With regard to supporting the early growth of spin-offs, literature has consistently emphasized the role of spatial and social proximity to universities in providing access to resources and facilitating technology transfer. However, little is known about the relationship between universities and their spin-offs, especially after incubation programs have been completed. Using a sample of 100 spin-offs from two universities in Europe, we develop several hypotheses predicting the motivation to maintain proximity to universities and the impact on performance. The findings suggest that factors such as research orientation, entrepreneurial orientation and market hostility encourage spin-offs to maintain proximity to universities. However, spin-offs experience diminishing returns in performance as commercial activities are reduced due to them over-pursuing proximity. More specifically, spin-offs with a high entrepreneurial orientation perform strongly if they are able to balance their level of proximity to universities. Our study contributes to the current discussion on the role of the university in supporting entrepreneurial activities and sparks a new debate on how to support the long-term growth of spin-offs, including differentiation in support according to entrepreneurial orientation, as well as flexibility in support. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Incubator; Performance; Proximity; Spin-offs; University,Technology transfer; Incubator; Performance; Proximity; Spin off; University; Economic and social effects; entrepreneur; performance assessment; technology transfer; university sector; Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056169123

The development of a hydrogen economy will increase the availability of distributed hydrogen as a pure gas. Alternatively, hydrogen may be blended with natural gas in the grid. This study investigates the performance of SOFC μCHP systems, while using a fuel varying from pure hydrogen to pure methane via mixtures of hydrogen and methane called Hythane. Flowsheet models of external as well as internal reforming fuel cell systems were developed in Cycle-Tempo simulation software. Results show that both the external as well as the internal reforming system can operated on all fuel gas compositions varying from pure hydrogen to pure methane, thus allowing for a transition towards a hydrogen economy via the mixing of hydrogen into the natural gas grid. Although the natural gas based systems have a higher electrical efficiency, the introduction of hydrogen into the gas leads to a higher total efficiency of the combined heat and power system. The addition of hydrogen into the fuel minimizes the problems of thermal stress and thermal shock associated with the use of methane in internal reforming fuel cell systems. The internal reforming system showed a higher performance compared to the external reforming system for all Hythane gas mixtures in terms of not only electrical efficiency but also in terms of thermal and total efficiency. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Distributed generation; Hythane; SOFC; μCHP,Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Distributed power generation; Efficiency; Fuel economy; Fuel systems; Gases; Hydrogen fuels; Methane; Natural gas; Natural gas wells; Combined heat and power production; Combined heat and power system; Electrical efficiency; Fuel gas composition; Hythane; Internal reforming; Natural gas grids; Simulation software; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); combined heat and power; comparative study; energy efficiency; fuel cell; hydrogen; natural gas; oxide; performance assessment; power generation; simulation; software; solid; Chandipura virus,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059931614

Decisions on this layout are important to companies as they allow them to balance customer service levels and logistics costs. Until now there has been very little descriptive research into the factors that drive decisions about these structures. Moreover, the literature on the topic is scattered across various research streams. In this paper we review and consolidate this literature, with the aim to arrive at a comprehensive list of factors. Three relevant research streams were identified: Supply Chain Management (SCM), Transportation and Geography. The SCM and Transportation literature mostly focus on distribution structure including distribution centre (DC) location selection from a viewpoint of service level and logistics costs factors. The Geography literature focuses on spatial DC location decisions and resulting patterns mostly explained by location factors such as labour and land availability. Our review indicates that the main factors that drive decision-making are “demand level”, “service level”, “product characteristics”, “logistics costs”, “labour and land”, “accessibility” and “contextual factors”. The main trade-off influencing distribution structure selection is “service level” versus “logistics costs”. Together, the research streams provide a rich picture of the factors that drive distribution structure including DC location selection. We conclude with a framework that shows the relative position of these factors. Future work can focus on completing the framework by detailing out the sub factors and empirically testing the direction and strength of relationships.

Hermeneutic TA aims at understanding the “meaning attributed to emerging technologies in societal discourses”. In this article, I will suggest that from the perspective of hermeneutic TA it becomes clear that TA has directed much attention to the “vanguard visions” of some rather elitist visionaries, whose narratives of technological futures have attracted a lot of media attention and stirred up societal debates. Nanotechnology is the most pertinent example. Meaning has been attributed to such comprehensive, techno-scientific futures, elevating them to form the backdrop of public discourses, technology assessments and policy-making. Such attribution carries a prescriptive power and pushes to political action or further social scientific inquiry. Acknowledging this should raise the awareness that many people's visions of the future are not part of the policy debates in which TA is involved and in which the future is negotiated. This imbalance might be expressed by saying that they do “not have a future”. In the present article, I will explore this notion and its normative implications. © 2019 The Author",Conceptual analysis; Diversifying futures; Future making; Hermeneutic Technology Assessment; Power imbalance,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063736015

The 1992 problem was to identify a strategy for reducing flood risk in the Netherlands by, for example, strengthening the river dikes against the risk of flooding. Since then, conditions related to flooding have been recognised as increasingly uncertain. In response, a new paradigm for strategic planning has emerged: the “adaptive planning approach,” which aims to identify and assess strategies allowing for change, learning, and adaptation over time. We found that using the adaptive planning approach in 1992 would not have changed the main conclusions. But, it would have made explicit the need for the identification of vulnerabilities of the chosen strategy, a monitoring system to keep track of the uncertainties, and the possible actions to deal with the vulnerabilities that can be taken as the world evolves. © 2018 The Authors.

The four main risk factors, the so-called SNAP-factors, relate to smoking, nutrition, alcohol consumption and physical inactivity. A consistent finding in health research is that these behaviors tend to cluster together, thereby resulting in patterns of healthy lifestyles and unhealthy ones. In research to date, physical (in)activity is typically included using broad categories relating to the total amount of physical (in)activity. As such, it is unknown to what extent active travel behaviors (i.e. walking and cycling) as specific forms of physical activity are related to the health lifestyles. Methods: In this study this knowledge gap is addressed by performing a latent class analysis based on indicators related to active travel as well as the four SNAP-factors. Data are obtained from the LISS (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social sciences) panel, which is based on a true probability sample of Dutch households. In total, 2050 participants are considered in the analysis. Results: Five health lifestyles are revealed and labeled as follows: consistent healthy, active commuters, physically inactive, unhealthy eaters and consistent unhealthy. The results indicate that active travel (or lack thereof) indeed forms an integral part of the consistent healthy (and unhealthy) lifestyles. In addition, lifestyle membership is found to be significantly dependent on gender, age and level of education. Conclusion: For most people (70%) active travel (or lack thereof) indeed forms an integral part of these consistent healthy and unhealthy lifestyles. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Active travel; Cycling; Health behaviors; Latent class analysis; SNAP factors; Walking,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057850355

To structure this analysis, we designed an assessment framework that provides a comprehensive tool for the assessment of balancing markets in Europe vis-à-vis DER participation. Our results show that flexible pooling conditions, a higher bidding frequency and product resolution, and the authorization of non-precontracted bids, among others, can significantly ease DER integration in the market.

This hampers the efforts of ports to anticipate on and respond to possible future changes in port choice by shippers, freight forwarders and carriers. The purpose of this paper is to develop and demonstrate a port performance measurement methodology, extended from the perspective of port choice, which includes hinterland performance and a weighting of attributes from a port choice perspective. Design/methodology/approach: A review of literature is used to extend the scope of port performance indicators. Multi-criteria decision analysis is used to operationalize the context of port choice, presenting a weighted approach using the Best-Worst Method (BWM). An empirical model is built based on an extensive port stakeholder survey. Findings: Transport costs and times along the transport chain are the dominant factors for port competitiveness. Satisfaction, reputation and flexibility criteria are the other important decision criteria. The results also show how the availability of different modal alternatives impact on the position of a port. A ranking of routes for hinterland regions is done. Originality/value: The paper focuses on two extensions of port performance measurement. So far, not all factors that determine port choice have been included in port performance studies. Here, first, factors related to hinterland services are included. Second, a weighting of port performance measures is proposed. The importance of factors is assessed using BWM. The approach is demonstrated empirically for a case of the European contestable hinterland regions, which so far have lacked quantitative analysis. © 2018, Jafar Rezaei, Linde van Wulfften Palthe, Lori Tavasszy, Bart Wiegmans and Frank van der Laan.",Best-Worst Method; BWM; MCDA; Multi-criteria decision analysis; Port performance measurement,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054560004

A number of alternatives like hydrogen or dimethyl ether/methanol synthesised using CO2 as feedstock for fuel production (hereafter refer to “CO2-based fuels”) have been proposed to combat climate change. However, the decarbonisation potential of CO2-based fuels is under debate because CO2 is re-emitted to the atmosphere when the fuel is combusted; and the majority of hydrogen still relies on fossil resources, which makes its prospects of being a low-carbon fuel dependent on its manufacturing process. First, this paper investigates the relative economic and environmental performance of hydrogen (produced from conventional steam methane reforming and produced via electrolysis using renewable energy), and CO2-based fuels (dimethyl ether and methanol), considering the full carbon cycle. The results reveal that hydrogen produced from steam methane reforming is the most economical option and that hydrogen produced via electrolysis using renewables has the best environmental profile. Whereas the idea of CO2-based fuels has recently gained much interest, it has for the foreseeable future rather limited practical relevance since there is no favourable combination of cost and environmental performance. This will only change in the long run and requires that CO2 is of non-fossil origin, i.e. from biomass combustion or captured from air. Second, this paper address unresolved methodological issues in the assessment of CO2-based fuels, such as the possible allocation of emissions to the different sectors involved. The outcomes indicate that implementing different allocation approaches substantially influences the carbon footprint of CO2-based fuels. To avoid allocation issues, expanding the boundaries including the entire system and is therefore recommended. © 2018 The Authors",Carbon capture and utilisation (CCU); Climate change mitigation; CO2-based fuel; Hydrogen; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Prospective technology assessment,Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Combustion; Electrolysis; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Ethers; Hydrogen; Hydrogen economy; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Methane; Methanol fuels; Steam reforming; Climate change mitigation; Comparative assessment; Economic and environmental performance; Environmental performance; Environmental profile; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Manufacturing process; Technology assessments; Alternative fuels; alternative fuel; assessment method; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; comparative study; electrokinesis; energy; hydrogen; life cycle analysis; manufacturing; technology; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058018655

The process of coming to an agreement on policy pathways requires critical reflection on underlying system conceptualizations and commitment to building capacity in all stakeholders engaged in a social learning process. Simulation models can support such processes by providing a boundary object or negotiating artifact that allows stakeholders to deliberate through a multi-interpretable, consistent, transparent, and verifiable representation of reality. The challenge is how to structure the transdisciplinary process of involving stakeholders in simulation modeling and how to know when such a process can be labeled as transformative. There is a proliferation of approaches for this across disciplines, of which this article identifies Group Model Building, Companion Modeling, Challenge-and-Reconstruct Learning, and generic environmental modeling as the most prominent. This article systematically reviews relevant theories, terminology, principles, and methodologies across these four approaches to build a framework that can facilitate further learning. The article also provides a typology of approaches to modeling with stakeholders. It distinguishes transformative approaches that involve stakeholders from representative, instrumental and nominal forms. It is based on an extensive literature review, supported by twenty-three semi-structured interviews with participatory and non-participatory modelers. The article brings order into the abundance of conceptions of transformation, the role of simulation models in transformative change processes, the role of participation of stakeholders, and what type of approaches to modeling with stakeholders are befitting in the development of policy pathways. © 2019 by the authors.",Collaboration; Decision making; Modeling; Policy pathways; Social learning; Social simulation; Transdisciplinary; Transformation,climate change; decision making; environmental modeling; learning; participatory approach; policy development; questionnaire survey; simulation; stakeholder,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061090186

In recent times it become more volatile due to increased integration of renewables that are intermittent. The issue of price volatility is further heightened during periods of grid congestion. Motivated by these problems, we propose a market design where, by constraining dual variables, we determine the amount of demand-side flexibility required to limit the rise of LMP. Through our proposed approach a price requesting load can specify its maximum willingness to pay for electricity and through demand-side flexibility hedge against price volatility. For achieving this, an organizational structure for flexibility management is proposed that exhibits the coordination required between the Distribution System Operator (DSO), an aggregator and the price requesting load.

However, most studies are based on strong assumptions, such as the need for a constant velocity of the target-ship, the limitation to two-ship scenarios, the simplification of ships’ dynamics, etc. Generalized Velocity Obstacle (GVO) algorithm can bridge these gaps. This paper presents a GVO algorithm for ship collision avoidance and designs a collision avoidance system (GVO-CAS). The proposed system visualizes the changes of one ship's course and speed resulting in collisions, which can be used not only for supporting the officer on watch to prevent collisions, but also for collision prevention of Autonomous Surface Vessels (ASVs) and for human operators taking over the control of ASVs. Simulation experiments show that the proposed collision avoidance system can work properly in various maritime environments. Compared to the original Velocity Obstacle algorithm, the GVO algorithm is more reliable and suitable for close range ship collision avoidance. Moreover, the GVO-CAS can offer rule-compliant evasive actions with a minimum number of required actions for ships. These results show the great potential to use the GVO algorithm in both manned and unmanned ships at sea. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Collision prevention; COLREGs compliance; Generalized velocity obstacle; Ship dynamics model,Collision avoidance; Safety devices; Unmanned surface vehicles; Velocity; Autonomous surface vessels; Collision avoidance systems; Collision prevention; COLREGs compliance; Maritime environment; Ship collision avoidance; Ship dynamics; Velocity obstacles; Ships; algorithm; collision; computer simulation; numerical model; ship motion; unmanned vehicle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059468877

With the inputs of these criteria and the alternative designs, a multi-criteria decision-making problem is formulated and solved using Best Worst Method (BWM). BWM finds the weights of the criteria. Using these weights, the ranking of the alternatives is found. The implementation of the analysis took place for three selected products of the Kraft Heinz Company.

These three cities are frontrunners in adopting a comprehensive smart city agenda, but they do so in different ways. The paper examines regulative, normative and cognitive elements of institutional arrangements, explores how they shape experimentation, and reflects on their place-based specificities.

Research on critical determinants of cooperation amongst transboundary water negotiation teams is limited. In this paper, we assess whether personal attribute diversity (PAD) is a stronger factor than demographic diversity (gender, age, and education play) in determining whether the negotiation team will cooperate or make unilateral actions. We use a negotiation game to study decisions taken by water policymakers. After that, we conduct a multiple discriminant analysis (MDA) to assess the influence of PAD, gender, age, and education on water negotiation outcomes. The findings indicate that PAD plays a significant role in determining whether the group will cooperate or compete. Gender, education, and age barely influence the outcome. Only upon removal of the PAD variable do we see an increase in the discriminant power of gender and education. Age has minimal influence on the negotiation outcomes. We apply the research at a lower level of governance (Nzoia River Basin). However, results might be extrapolated to a bigger basin, like the Nile Basin, through future multiple level analysis which takes account of the complex socio-technical systems. © 2019 by the authors.",Cooperation; Demographic diversity (DD); Multiple discriminant analysis (MDA); Negotiation game; Negotiation teams; Nzoia River Basin; Personal attributes diversity (PAD); Shared superordinate identity (SSI); Unilateral actions; Water resources management,Catchments; Discriminant analysis; Human resource management; Population statistics; Watersheds; Cooperation; Demographic diversity (DD); Multiple discriminant analysis; Negotiation game; Negotiation teams; Personal attributes; River basins; Shared superordinate identity (SSI); Unilateral actions; Water resources management; Water resources; action research; demographic survey; discriminant analysis; drainage basin; education; game theory; gender issue; multicriteria analysis; negotiation process; state role; transboundary cooperation; water management; Kenya; Nile Basin; Nzoia Basin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060981494

One main reason for the stagnation is weak cross-county cooperation between hydrologically interdependent governments. WASREB has little guidance on what indicators to use to enhance cross-county water cooperation. Through literature review, we assess whether the UN-Water methodology for assessing Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 6.5.2 would provide useful guidelines. Based on the literature review outcomes, we design a water policy game known as Nzoia WeShareIt. After that, we play seven-game sessions in four county governments (Busia, Bungoma, Kakamega, and Trans Nzoia), on 11-22 July 2016. We use the in-game and post-game questionnaire data to measure learning outcomes on interdependence and cooperation. The findings indicate that Nzoia WeShareIt policy game as a form of experiential learning increased understanding on the value of cross-county cooperation. The study constitutes a practical guideline to WASREB and a quick reference tool to be explored when designing indicators to monitor cross-county cooperation. We also propose a mixed method approach that incorporates team interdependence indicators as distinct and separate indicators from cooperation. Moreover, we recommend strengthening SDG 6.5.2 indicator to measure transboundary water cooperation inputs, processes and outcomes. © 2019 by the author.",Benefit sharing; Equity; Nzoia river basin; SDG Indicator 6.5.2.; Sustainability; Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); Team interdependence; Transboundary water cooperation; Water policy games,cooperative sector; environmental monitoring; equity; government; guideline; literature review; river basin; sustainability; sustainable development; transboundary cooperation; United Nations; water planning; Bungoma; Busia [Kenya]; Kakamega; Kenya; Trans Nzoia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060376551

Fundamental insight into the catalyst particle formation process is therefore of industrial importance when addressing specific requirements in the final products. In the present work, we fully characterize a single-step catalyst preparation process, which comprises a reactive precipitation of a MgCl 2 -supported Ziegler-Natta catalyst, through decomposition of the hetero-bimetallic complex, Mg(OR) 2 ·Ti(OR) 4 , by addition of ethyl aluminum dichloride (EADC). We track the evolution of both of the concentrations of the metals (Mg, Ti, Al) as well as Cl in the liquid phase and the size of the formed catalyst particles. It is observed that the liquid-phase composition is governed by the EADC feed rate under fully Cl-starved conditions. The process can be divided into two stages: The first stage is dominated by the precipitation of the Mg-based support, and the second stage involves complex adsorption-precipitation of the Ti species. The growth of the catalyst particle size occurs only in the first stage and is controlled by the aggregation and breakage events during the MgCl 2 precipitation. It follows that the hydrodynamic stress in the reactor plays the essential role in controlling the catalyst size. In the second stage, no further particle growth occurs, not only because of the depletion of Mg in the liquid phase but also because the adsorbed Ti complex stabilizes the particles against aggregation. Finally, we have performed polymerization tests with the prepared catalysts and found that the size distribution of the polymer particles indeed closely replicates the one of the used catalyst particles. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,Agglomeration; Aluminum compounds; Chlorine compounds; Liquids; Magnesium compounds; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Precipitation (chemical); Size distribution; Titanium compounds; Catalyst particle size; Catalyst performance; Catalyst preparation; Complex adsorptions; Hetero bimetallic complexes; Hydrodynamic stress; Liquid phase compositions; Ziegler-Natta catalysts; Catalyst supports,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85060180695

The narratives reveal that actors hold different beliefs concerning the magnitude of the erosion problem, the division of responsibilities and the suitability of sand nourishment as a coastal protection measure. The narrative competition is considered reflective of past institutional discussions and ongoing institutional work in coastal management in Scania, confirming that narratives are used as sense-making and meaning-giving devices in institutional discussions. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Based on a literature review and expert interviews, we study the factors for technology success in the residential grid storage market. By applying the best worst method (BWM), we assign the relative importance to the factors and predict which technology will have the highest chance of achieving success.

What is missing in the current debate on sex robots and their potential impact on human social relations is a targeted look at the boundedness and bodily expressivity typically characteristic of humans, the role that these dimensions of human embodiment play in enabling reciprocal human interactions, and the manner in which this contrasts with sex robot-human interactions. Through a fine-grained discussion of these themes, rooted in fruitful but largely untapped resources from the field of enactive embodied cognition, we explore the unique embodiment of sex robots. We argue that the embodiment of the sex robot is constituted by what we term restricted expressivity and a lack of bodily boundedness and that this is the locus of negative but also potentially positive implications. We discuss the possible benefits that these two dimensions of embodiment may have for people within a specific demographic, namely some persons on the autism spectrum. Our preliminary conclusion-that the benefits and the downsides of sex robots reside in the same capability of the robot, its restricted expressivity and lack of bodily boundedness as we call it-demands we take stock of future developments in the design of sex robot embodiment. Given the importance of evidence-based research pertaining to sex robots in particular, as reinforced by Nature (2017) for drawing correlations and making claims, the analysis is intended to set the stage for future research. © 2019 Philosophy Documentation Center.

The Pastor-Zienkiewicz model (P-Z model) based on generalized plastic mechanics theory has a strict theoretical base, but it involves many parameters. Moreover, the determination of parameter a entails high discreteness because of experimental conditions, and this discreteness influences the accuracy of simulation analysis. The mechanical properties of earth-rockfill dam materials were simulated using the P-Z model in this study to optimize parameter a of the model and decrease its discreteness. First, conventional triaxial shear test results of earth-rock materials were denoised with the empirical mode decomposition method. Second, a method to optimize parameter a was proposed by using cloud theory. Lastly, a numerical simulation analysis of the triaxial shearing test was performed with the optimized P-Z model. Research results demonstrate that the entropy error and hyper entropy error rates of the triaxial shearing test data decline by 35% and 67%, respectively, and the cloud droplet range of parameter a is narrowed by 32%. The discreteness of the values decreases significantly. The simulation calculation results are consistent with the test results, thereby confirming the reasonability of the proposed parameter optimization method. The optimized P-Z model can simulate the mechanical properties of earth-rockfill dam materials accurately. This study can provide a theoretical reference for finite element simulation analysis of earth-rockfill dam structures. © 2019 School of Science, IHU.",Cloud theory; Empirical mode decomposition emd; Parameter α; Parameters optimization; Pastor-Zienkiewicz model,Constitutive models; Dams; Entropy; Errors; Mechanical properties; Rock mechanics; Shearing; Cloud theory; Determination of parameters; Empirical Mode Decomposition; Empirical mode decomposition method; Generalized plastic mechanics; Numerical simulation analysis; Parameter optimization methods; Parameters optimization; Rocks,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081043554

However, especially in digital learning contexts, students feel being disconnected from the anonymous group of learners, leading to low-quality feedback. When feedback is open, and counterparts are known, this knowledge can lead to biases when commenting on each other’s work. We developed a game-based learning environment called ‘The Great Library’ that we used to analyse the effect of avatars as game element to limit the effects of both fully anonymous and fully open feedback. Students and teachers using the new game-based learning environment were asked to provide feedback on their experiences with the learning environment and the use of avatars. The responses were compared to the same course provided without game elements. The qualitative data analysis reveals that the introduction of avatars still lacks acceptance on the side of the students, yet that they feel a sense of community in the GBL. Open and direct feedback is still used and appreciated by the students. The anonymity of the peer reviews resulting from the use of the avatars represents a challenge for the student-teacher interaction. The environment and set-up of the course in a whole still needs some adjustment in order to fully support the learning process of the students. © The Authors, 2019.

Such uncertainty makes the accurate reflection of the running status of earth-rock dams of traditional safety assessment results impossible. Thus, this study proposed a safety assessment model of earth-rock dams based on the combination weighting method of ideal point and the cloud theory model. The proposed model was used to scientifically solve the uncertainty during the safety assessment of earth-rock dams. Real and reliable weights of indexes were determined using the combination weighting method based on the ideal point. Then, the safety evaluation grade ranges of each evaluation index were divided on the basis of the measured data. These grade ranges were ""softened"" by combining cloud theory. The proposed safety assessment model was applied to an earth-rock dam in the reservoir of a pumped storage station in Tai'an City, Shandong Province, China. Results demonstrate that: (1) the proposed model can effectively solve fuzzy and random problems during the safety assessment of earth-rock dams, and (2) the results show that the safety of the investigated earth-rock dam is in a normal running state. This outcome reflects the actual conditions of the earth-rock dam. The proposed model provides references in the diagnosis and decision making in the earth-rock dam management department. © 2019 School of Science, IHU.",Cloud theory; Combination weighting method; Earth-rock dam; Ideal point; Safety assessment,Dams; Decision making; Digital storage; Pumped storage power plants; Rocks; Safety engineering; Cloud theory; Combination weighting method; Earth-rock dam; Ideal point; Safety assessments; Reservoirs (water),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072976433

However, governments are often reluctant to disclose their data due to possible disadvantages. These disadvantages, at the same time, can be circumstances by processing the data before disclosing. Investments are needed to be able to pre-process a dataset. Hence, a trade-off between the benefits and cost of opening data needs to be made. Decisions to disclose are often made based on binary options like “open” or “closed” the data, whereas also parts of a dataset can be opened or only pre-processed data. The objective of this study is to develop a decision tree analysis in open data (DTOD) to estimate the costs and benefits of disclosing data using a DTA approach. Experts’ judgment is used to quantify the pay-offs of possible consequences of the costs and benefits and to estimate the chance of occurrence. The result shows that for non-trivial decisions the DTOD helps, as it allows the creation of decision structures to show alternatives ways of opening data and the benefits and disadvantages of each alternative. © 2019, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Benefits; Costs; Decision tree analysis; Estimation; Investments; Open data; Open government,Cost estimating; Costs; Data handling; Decision trees; Economic and social effects; Electronic commerce; Estimation; Investments; Open Data; Trees (mathematics); Benefits; Benefits and costs; Costs and benefits; Decision tree analysis; Government institutions; Non-trivial; Open government; Pre-processed data; Cost benefit analysis,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85072890682

A service-oriented enterprise (SOE) strategy is an approach that decomposes an enterprise into business services that are modular, accessible, and interoperable, in which parts can be provided in-house, or outsourced to the market. The SOE concept has mainly been approached from a technological view and little is known about what type of strategic SOE determinants are relevant. A firm’s strategy to implement an SOE requires top management support. Therefore, insights at executive level are a prerequisite to identify strategic business directions. We conducted a literature review and a qualitative case study amongst eleven firms at executive level in various industries. Business services, business processes, and enabling technology were found in the literature as key determinants influencing a firm’s SOE strategy. Subsequently, the interviews at executive level identified that organizational readiness, knowledge and skills, and governance also affect the SOE strategy of firms. We suggest that a holistic view is required to study the complexity of an SOE. By using an executive view we contribute to IS and business literature as strategic SOE determinants become more explicit. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Business processes; Business services; Enabling technology; Service-oriented enterprise; Strategic decision-making,Decision making; Business Process; Business service; Enabling technologies; Service oriented enterprise; Strategic decision making; Interoperability,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85070946807

However, such increments have made it more complex to manage the regional vessel traffic, which can increase the risk of an accident in the area. To model and analyze the relationship between vessel traffic and maritime traffic, this paper proposes a gridded geography information system (GIS)-based relation analysis model using the historical automatic identification system (AIS) data and accident records over a 10-year-span. Firstly, the extent of the hazards posed by a maritime accident in terms of hull loss, fatality, and direct economic loss is quantified using set pair analysis. Consequently, the hazardous degree posed by an accident is obtained. The relative consequence of the regional hazard (RCORH) is then estimated by summing up all the relative hazardous degrees of accidents that have occurred in a certain gridded area. Secondly, the vessel traffic in the gridded areas is analyzed using characteristics such as speed, heading variance, and traffic volume as indicators. Based on the analysis of both the maritime traffic accidents and the vessel traffic, the spatial relationships are analyzed with an overlay between the RCORH and vessel traffic data of each grid, as well as a regression analysis. In a case study of the Western port of Shenzhen City, China, the methodology proves to be effective for vessel traffic management and traffic engineering design. © 2019 by the authors.",Collision accident; Maritime safety; Relation model; Set pair analysis; Vessel traffic,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85069223407

The cases also show that architectural governance depends on the context and there is no best way of EA governance that fits very situation. Architectural governance complements enterprise architecture and should ensure that EA efforts are coordinated and used by the business to improve firm performance. In many cases EA and architectural governance were found to be strongly connected, making it difficult to separate them.

On the basis of analyzing the risk formation path, a risk evaluation indicator system was established which included the hazards, exposure and vulnerability factors. Variable Fuzzy Sets theory was introduced into the risk evaluation of life loss risk grades and applied to eight collapsed dams in China. According to the sequence of the risk grades of these dams, the evaluation result was mainly consistent with the actual mortality ranking sequence, showing that the model could be effectively applied to the risk evaluation of life loss in dam-break events.

These Variable Fuzzy evaluation models and grouping suggestions could help stakeholders to allocate the funds for dam reinforcement more accurately and provide a scientific basis for the study of dam-break life loss and dam risk management. © 2019 by the authors.",Dam-break; Life loss; Risk; Variable fuzzy,Floods; Risk management; Risks; Dam reinforcement; Dam-breaks; Evaluation results; Grouping operations; Scientific basis; Variable fuzzy; Variable fuzzy sets theories; Vulnerability factors; Dams; dam failure; flood; fuzzy mathematics; hazard assessment; model; mortality; population distribution; reinforcement; risk assessment; vulnerability,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068555420

Governments actively stimulate the opening of data to increase citizen engagement to support policy-making processes. Evidence-based policy-making is the situation whereby decisions made are based on factual data. The common expectation is that releasing data will result in evidence-based decision-making and more trust in government decisions. This study aims to provide insight into how evidence-based policy based on open data can result into uncertainty and even polarize the policy-making process. We analyze a case study in which traffic and road utilization datasets are used and model the decision-making process using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN). The BPMN model shows how the government and business organizations can use the data and give different interpretations. Data-driven decision-making might potentially create uncertainty, polarization, and less trust in decisions as stakeholders can give different meanings to the data and arrive at different outcomes. In contrast to the common belief, we found that the more data released, the more discussions happened about what is desired according to the data. The various directions derived from the data can even polarize decisionmaking. In other words, the more data opened, the more people can construct their perception of reality. For further research, we recommend understanding the types and role of data to create an evidence-based approach. © 2019 International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.",Data-driven; Decision-making; Evidence-based; Open data; Polarization; Trust; Uncertainty,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85068398936

To position the research discussed in this section meaningfully, our introductory article aims to create an overview of the state-of-the-art of open data policy-making research and to derive an emerging research agenda from this overview. We found that much research has been done in the field of open data in the past few decades. However, the number of conducted systematic literature reviews concerning open data research is limited and literature reviews that have included aspects related to open data policy-making are even more rare. Our analysis of eight systematic literature review articles that include the topic of open data policy-making shows that these articles contain four main content-related elements: Open data policy-making, a discussion of open data policy-making research, theory used in open data policy-making research and suggested areas for future research about open data policy-making. We discuss each of these areas and we outline emerging research directions categorized by three main topics: 1) open data policy-making and theory development, 2) open data policy-making effects, and 3) open data policy-making from a multi-actor perspective. Finally, we provide an overview of the papers included in this section on open data policy-making. © 2019 IOS Press and the authors.

However, such ratios provide little information regarding the uncertainty of the overall performance of the corresponding systems. The comparison is also drawn merely by the juxtaposition of computed scores, and specify that one system is superior to one another provided that its score is higher. Nonetheless, the comparison based solely on two figures would not quantify the significance of difference and would not determine the extent to which one system is better. The problem compounds for comparison over multiple benchmarks since averages and micro-averages of performance scores are considered. In this paper, the evaluation of alignment systems is translated into a statistical inference problem by introducing the notion of risk for alignment systems. The risk with respect to a performance score is shown to follow a binomial distribution and is equivalent to the complement of the score, e.g., precision risk =-1 precision. It is also demonstrated that the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is precisely equivalent to the conventional evaluation by using ratios. Instead of using the MLE, the Bayesian model is developed to estimate the risk with respect to a score (or equivalently, the score itself) as a probability distribution from the performance of the systems over single or multiple benchmarks. As a result, the evaluation outcome is a distribution instead of a figure, which provides a broader view of the overall system performance. A Bayesian test is also devised to compare various systems based on their estimated risks, which can compute the confidence that one system is superior to one another. We report the result of applying the proposed methodology to multiple tracks from the ontology alignment evaluation initiative (OAEI). © 2019 IEEE.",Bayesian; evaluation; ontology alignment; precision; recall,Bayesian networks; Benchmarking; Maximum likelihood estimation; Ontology; Statistical tests; Bayesian; evaluation; Ontology alignment; precision; recall; Risk perception,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066880161

Whereas the former two can be considered 'rentier states' heavily depending on oil (and gas) revenues, the latter only leans on oil for a mere 6% of its gross domestic product (GDP). Although the economic rise has brought considerable welfare, it has also led these emirates to attain the world's highest per capita carbon footprint. To address this problem Qatar, Abu Dhabi and Dubai seem to have formulated policies with regard to sustainable urbanisation and adopted strong branding strategies to promote them internally and externally. In this paper we examine which steps have been taken to substantiate their claims to sustainable urbanisation, in branding as well as in actions taken towards implementation. We find that all three have been very active in branding their sustainable urbanisation policies, through visions and policy frameworks as well as prestigious development projects, but that the former is substantially more impressive than the latter. Results also show there is a difference between Abu Dhabi and Qatar on the one hand, and Dubai on the other. Dubai has large number of small 'free economic zones', academic institutions for developing a knowledge economy, and smart and/or sustainable urban neighbourhoods, while Qatar and Abu Dhabi have a small number of very large ones. From the three, it is currently Dubai which has taken the lead in this development, largely completing its industrial transition with vast economic diversification and urban expansion. However, across the board this has had little effect on its ecological footprint. © 2019 by the authors.",City branding; Emirates; Qatar; Rentier state; Sustainable urban development,Carbon footprint; Economics; Environmental impact; City branding; Emirates; Qatar; Rentier state; Sustainable urban development; Urban growth,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85066021284

To guarantee satisfactory decisions in the face of deep uncertainties, adaptive policy pathways might be used. Adaptive policy pathways are designed to take actions according to how the future will actually unfold. In adaptive pathways, a monitoring system collects the evidence required for activating the next adaptive action. This monitoring system is made of signposts and triggers. Signposts are indicators that track the performance of the pathway. When signposts reach pre-specified trigger values, the next action on the pathway is implemented. The effectiveness of the monitoring system is pivotal to the success of adaptive policy pathways, therefore the decision-makers would like to have sufficient confidence about the future capacity to adapt on time. ""On time"" means activating the next action on a pathway neither so early that it incurs unnecessary costs, nor so late that it incurs avoidable damages. In this paper, we show how mapping the relations between triggers and the probability of misclassification errors inform the level of confidence that a monitoring system for adaptive policy pathways can provide. Specifically, we present the ""trigger-probability"" mapping and the ""trigger-consequences"" mappings. The former mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given signpost and the level of confidence regarding whether change occurs and adaptation is needed. The latter mapping displays the interplay between trigger values for a given signpost and the consequences of misclassification errors for both adapting the policy or not. In a case study, we illustrate how these mappings can be used to test the effectiveness of a monitoring system, and how they can be integrated into the process of designing an adaptive policy. © 2019 by the authors.",Adaptation; Adaptive policies; Afsluitdijk; Changing extremes; Climate change; Extremes; Flood protection; Monitoring; Resilience; Risk management,adaptive management; classification; climate change; decision making; extreme event; flood forecasting; monitoring system; probability; risk assessment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063473024

We build on the dynamic capability view of the firm to explain business model evolution and innovation, looking particularly at the dynamics that are created by interactions between business model components over time. We use the following four criteria to assess the degree of dynamics in business model frameworks: completeness of business model aspects, interrelationships between aspects, interrelationships over time, and framework changes over time and across contexts. Business model completeness involves internal company aspects and external environmental aspects. Interrelationships of business model aspects are required to assess business model coherence, which is an important indicator of business model quality. Interrelationships between the environment and business model aspects are required to assess the fit of a particular business model in its context. Interrelationships of these aspects over time are needed to understand business model evolution. Finally, business model frameworks need to be adapted over time and across contexts to keep frameworks simple and useful yet complete. Our analysis shows that current business model frameworks do not meet all four criteria, and thus only partly incorporate dynamics. © 2019 by the authors.",Business model canvas; Business models; Criteria; Dynamic capabilities; Dynamics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85063465504

Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","Final disposal of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from nuclear power plants (NPPs) is an ethical issue with implications within and across generations. We address this issue from the perspective of nuclear communities that host nuclear waste disposal sites. These are primarily the communities that face injustice due to the potential radiological risks. A resident survey (n = 454) was conducted in two Finnish nuclear communities, i.e. Eurajoki and Pyhäjoki, that are being considered as alternative sites for a second repository for SNF. The nuclear waste management (NWM) company Posiva is already building a repository in Eurajoki, the first in Finland. These communities are in different stages of their lifecycles as nuclear communities. We investigated the residents’ conceptions of justice and trust regarding the repository SNF management and its main actors, and how these conceptions related to acceptance of the repository. The main findings show that residents of both communities perceived intragenerational and intergenerational injustices to be important in the procedures and the distribution of risks and benefits of the proposed repository. Claims regarding justice and trust were related to the acceptance of the repository. The community with the longer history with NWM expressed greater mistrust and perceived greater procedural injustice than the community with less earlier experience, which–in turn–expressed more concern over intragenerational distributive justice than the former community. Moreover, having longer history with NWM did not lead to a different understanding regarding responsibility toward future generations as resident’s in both communities expressed similar concern over intergenerational justice. Moreover, having more experience of NWM did not enhance local acceptance. We emphasize that these results should be understood in the light of the prevailing situation in Finland, where the planning of the second repository is at a very early stage. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Within this framework, flood risk management is conceptualized as a coupled human-flood system. The human subsystem includes individuals and their behaviour and institutions that shape human-flood interaction. The framework presents a dynamic integration between agent-based models of individuals and institutions and numerical flood models. We demonstrate the framework's modelling application by examining the effects of three institutions in the Caribbean island of Sint Maarten. The case study shows the capabilities of the framework by exploring impacts of existing policies on flood risk reduction. Coupled agent-based-flood models built using the framework are useful to analyse policy options that address flood hazard and communities' vulnerability and exposure to support policy decision making. These models also show how flood risk changes over time in relation to the human dynamics on the urban environment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Agent-based modelling; Coupled human-flood systems; Flood risk management; Institutions; Socio-hydrology; Urban flood modelling,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Decision making; Flood control; Risk assessment; Risk management; Simulation platform; Societies and institutions; Agent-based modelling; Flood risk management; Flood risk reduction; Modelling framework; Physical components; Urban environments; Urban flood modelling; Urban flood risks; Floods; decision making; flood; flood control; modeling; nature-society relations; policy analysis; risk assessment; urban ecosystem; vulnerability; Leeward Islands [Lesser Antilles]; Saint Martin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85059297655

Box 5048, Delft, GA  2600, Netherlands","Many experts believe the transport system is about to change dramatically. This change is due to so-called fully-automated vehicles (AVs). However, at present, there are numerous important knowledge gaps that need to be solved for the successful integration of AVs in our transport systems, in particular regarding the impacts of AVs on travel demand. For instance, full automation will enable passengers to perform other, non-driving, related tasks while traveling to their destination. This may substantially change the way in which passengers experience traveling by car, and, in turn, may lead to considerable changes in the so-called Value of Travel Time (VOTT). Many experts anticipate the VOTT to decrease substantially due to AVs. However, the extent to which VOTT will change is currently far from clear. This study aims to develop new insights on the potential impacts of fully automated vehicles on the VOTT for commute trips. To do so, we first look at the existing microeconomics theory on the perceived VOTT and analyze the expected changes accrued from the effect of working and having leisure in an AV. We conclude that the VOTT of a work vehicle should be lower than what is experienced today in a conventional vehicle but the leisure one could stay the same. Then we conduct a stated choice experiment, specifically designed and administered for measuring the VOTT, and analyze these data using discrete choice models (DCMs). In total, we collected data from about 500 respondents. In the experiment, respondents were presented choice tasks consisting of three alternatives: an AV with office interior, an AV with leisure interior, and a conventional car. The same experiment was also given to another sample of respondents but this time describing a chauffeur-driven vehicle. Overall we find the average VOTT for an AV with an office interior (5.50€/h) to be lower than the VOTT for the conventional car (7.47€/h), however the AV with leisure interior is not found to decrease the value of time (8.17€/h) which confirms the theoretical results. The VOTT for the chauffeur experiment is systematically lower than for the AV experiment which we attribute to some distrust that people have regarding the AVs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Automated vehicles (AVs); Discrete choice models (DCMs); Driverless vehicles; Microeconomics theory; Stated choice (SC); Value of travel time (VOTT),Automation; Behavioral research; Economics; Leisure; Travel time; Automated vehicles; Discrete choice models; Driverless; Microeconomics theory; Stated choice; Value of travel time (VOTT); Vehicles; discrete choice analysis; leisure industry; microeconomics; transportation mode; travel demand; travel time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058147350

Accessing and aggregating different sources of data, including data outside the public domain, has the potential to provide insights for many societal challenges. This catalyzes new forms of partnerships between public, private, and nongovernmental actors aimed at leveraging different sources of data for positive societal impact and the public good. In practice there are different terms in use to label these partnerships but research has been lagging behind in systematically examining this trend. In this paper, we deconstruct the conceptualization and examine the characteristics of this emerging phenomenon by systematically reviewing academic and practitioner literature. To do so, we use the grounded theory literature review method. We identify several concepts which are used to describe this phenomenon and propose an integrative definition of “data driven social partnerships” based on them. We also identify a list of challenges which data driven social partnerships face and explore the most urgent and most cited ones, thereby proposing a research agenda.

In particular, we explore the impact of attitudes on preferences and choices regarding business models. We examine three business models in the present study: battery leasing, vehicle leasing and mobility guarantee. We design a stated choice experiment to disentangle the effect of business models from other factors and estimate a hybrid choice model. According to the results, the preferences for business models depend on the vehicle type: for battery electric vehicle (BEV), vehicle leasing is the most preferred option and battery leasing is the least preferred, while for conventional cars (CV) and plug-in hybrids (PHEV) the traditional business model of full purchase remains more popular. The attitudes of pro-convenience, pro-ownership and pro-EV leasing are all significantly associated with the choice of business models. As for mobility guarantee, we do not find any significant effect on utility. Finally, we discuss the implications for business strategy and government policy derived from our results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Business model; Consumer preference; Electric vehicle; Leasing; Mobility guarantee,automobile; business development; consumption behavior; electric vehicle; governance approach; policy approach; preference behavior; technology adoption,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056169276

Smart energy systems are considered as a solution to optimize and make energy systems ‘future-proof’. Their introduction, however, is challenged by a complex multi-stakeholder configuration, and by ‘rules of the game’ (institutional conditions) which are essential for the cooperation between stakeholders but perceived to be outdated. To address this issue, the central research question in this article is: ‘which institutional conditions enable or disable decision-making processes regarding the introduction of smart energy systems in selected city district development projects?’ We conducted in-depth interviews and collected secondary data for four case studies in the Netherlands. Data were analysed, and cases were compared using the Institutional Analysis and Development framework, and the method of causal process tracing. The results reveal that only stakeholders in the position of project leader were actively pursuing the projects’ goals (position rules), legal barriers as well as path dependency of previous decisions limited the available choices (choice rules), and agreement was lacking on sharing costs and benefits (aggregation rules). As ‘rules of the game’ for decision-making continue to present a challenge for the introduction of smart energy systems, future research and policy-making should pay attention to the creation and adequate orchestration of such rules. © 2018 The Authors",Decision-making; Governance; Institutions; Smart energy system,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055129799

However, much recent work on big data in public decision-making assumes a rational view of decision-making, which has been much criticized in the public administration debate. In this paper, we apply this view, and a more political one, to the context of big data and offer a qualitative study. We question the impact of big data on decision-making, realizing that big data – including its new methods and functions – must inevitably encounter existing political and managerial institutions. By studying two illustrative cases of big data use processes, we explore how these two worlds meet. Specifically, we look at the interaction between data analysts and decision makers. In this we distinguish between a rational view and a political view, and between an information logic and a decision logic. We find that big data provides ample opportunities for both analysts and decision makers to do a better job, but this doesn't necessarily imply better decision-making, because big data also provides opportunities for actors to pursue their own interests. Big data enables both data analysts and decision makers to act as autonomous agents rather than as links in a functional chain. Therefore, big data's impact cannot be interpreted only in terms of its functional promise; it must also be acknowledged as a phenomenon set to impact our policymaking institutions, including their legitimacy. © 2018 The Authors",,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055115327

To achieve high demand response participation, the European Union recognises the need for adequate financial incentives for all consumers, especially for residential and service sector consumers. However, the European Energy Tax Directive, which regulates energy taxation in the European Union, is currently not in alignment with this vision, as it does not provide any financial incentives for demand response participation. This paper explores the potential of energy taxes to provide such incentives. First, through an analysis of the current energy taxation and demand response literature. Second, by quantifying the difference in financial incentives between two tax designs (per-unit and ad valorem taxes) in a simulation case study of consumers heat pumps in the Netherlands. Results show that financial incentives are 3.5 times higher for the ad valorem tax than for the per-unit tax.

The analysis shows that the reviewed studies predominantly focus on a subset of barriers – a lack of capital, a lack of information, high upfront cost, ignorance, inertia and other priorities. So far, agent-based models have focused on how subsidies, technology bans and information campaigns influence energy efficiency adoption. There is ample opportunity for future agent-based modelling research on energy efficiency adoption policy by studying other residential technologies, other barriers, and other policies that fit the agent-based modelling paradigm well. © 2018 The Authors",Adoption barriers; Agent-based models; Energy efficiency policy; Energy efficient technology; Literature review,Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Adoption barriers; Agent-based model; Energy efficiency policies; Energy efficient technology; Literature reviews; Energy efficiency,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054014976

The real world, however, also includes a huge number of social components—people, communities, institutions, regulations and everything that exists in the human mind—that have shaped and been shaped by the technological components. Smart urban ecosystems are examples of large-scale Socio-Technical Systems (STS) that rely on technologies, in particular on the Internet-of-Things (IoT), within a complex social context where the technologies are embedded. Designing applications that embed both social complexity and IoT in large-scale STS requires a Socio-Technical (ST) approach, which has not yet entered the mainstream of design practice. This chapter reviews the literature and presents our experience of adopting an ST approach to the design of a community-oriented smart grid application. It discusses the challenges, process and outcomes of this apporach, and provides a set of lessons learned derived from this experience that are also deemed relevant to the design of other smart urban ecosystems. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.",,Ecosystems; Electric power transmission networks; Embedded systems; Smart power grids; Engineering design; Internet of thing (IOT); Smart grid applications; Social components; Sociotechnical systems; Technological components; Traditional engineerings; Urban ecosystem; Internet of things,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051746524

In this paper, we propose a game-based approach that can be replicated in any river basin, to assess trust and collaboration processes. In particular, we used the pre-game, in-game, and post-game assessment results to assess the relationship between Cooperation and Competition; Trust and Trustworthiness; Trust and Distrust; and (Dis) trust, Complexity, and Uncertainty. The initial assessment of respondents' propensity to trust (PTS) was divided into two variables (trust and trustworthiness) while adopting the unidimensional view of trust and distrust. We later examined whether we could separate the two constructs using a multidimensional scaling (MDS) technique known as the ALSCAL procedure. There are potentially significant results. Namely, that: trustworthiness and trust are not complementary; both cooperation and competition coexisted and increased throughout the game; more profound complexity and uncertainty led to an increment in trust, and reduced complexity and uncertainty led to a decrease in distrust. Based on the results and discussions, we provide recommendations for further research on trust, trustworthiness, and distrust in the river basin management context. © 2018 by the authors.",Competition; Complexity; Deep uncertainty; Distrust; Nzoia river basin; Risk perception; Trust; Trustworthiness; Water cooperation; Water policy gaming,basin management; competition (economics); complexity; environmental policy; risk perception; river basin; uncertainty analysis; Kenya; Nzoia Basin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85058145030

Three trends provide evidence for this: (i) the number of firm level relevant factors for platform success is steadily increasing, (ii) contemporary cases of platform competition take less time to unfold, and (iii) industries converge. These trends suggest that there is a change: in the time required for relevant factors to influence platform competition, and in the trade-offs managers face when they take actions in platform development and competition, to influence the market outcome of such processes. Current frameworks in the literature do not account explicitly for such timing issues.

The aim of our study is to contribute to the effective use of HEMSs by identifying types of homeowners in relation to the use of a HEMS. The research methods used were a literature review and the Q-method. A survey using the Q-method was conducted among 39 owners of single-family homes in various Rotterdam neighbourhoods. In order to find shared views among respondents, a principal component analysis (PCA) was performed. Five different types of homeowners could be distinguished: the optimists, the privacy-conscious, the technicians, the sceptics, and the indifferent. Their opinions vary as regards the added value of a HEMS, what characteristics a HEMS should have, how much confidence they have in the energy-saving effect of such systems, and their views on the privacy and safety associated with using a HEMS. The target group classification can be used as input for a way in which local stakeholders, e.g., a municipality, can offer HEMSs that are in line with the wishes of the homeowner. © 2018 by the authors.

Augmented reality (AR) systems with contactless tracking of the hand and upper body offer opportunities for objective quantification of motor (dys)function in a challenging, engaging and patient-tailored environment. In this study, we explore the potential of AR for evaluating 1) speed and goal-directedness of movements within the individually determined interaction space, 2) adaptation of hand opening to objects of different sizes, and 3) obstacle avoidance in healthy individuals (N = 10) and two highly prevalent neurological conditions (N = 10 patients with Parkinson’s Disease and N = 10 stroke patients). We successfully implemented three AR games to evaluate these key aspects of motor function. As expected, PD patients moved slower than controls and needed more time for task completion. No differences were observed between stroke patients and controls, perhaps because motor impairments in this patient group were relatively mild. Importantly, usability of our AR system was good and considerably improved compared to our previous study due to more natural and patient-tailored interaction. Although our findings testify to the potential of AR for assessing motor impairments in patients with neurological conditions and provide starting points for further improvement, there are still many steps to be taken towards application in clinical practice. © 2018, The Author(s).",Augmented reality; Engagement; Motor function; Parkinson’s disease; Stroke; Upper extremity,adult; Article; cerebrovascular accident; clinical article; controlled study; disease duration; female; game; human; male; middle aged; Montreal cognitive assessment; motor dysfunction; motor performance; object manipulation; Parkinson disease; personal experience; questionnaire; software; stroke patient; upper limb; aged; computer interface; convalescence; kinesiotherapy; Parkinson disease; pathophysiology; procedures; severity of illness index; stroke rehabilitation; video game; virtual reality; Aged; Exercise Therapy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease; Recovery of Function; Severity of Illness Index; Stroke Rehabilitation; Upper Extremity; User-Computer Interface; Video Games; Virtual Reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055616638

We adopt a comparative approach to analyse qualitative evidence from three jurisdictions, namely, Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Australia. Regulators across these jurisdictions have been both pioneers and leaders internationally to transform business-to-government reporting in multi-agency settings. Our analyses illustrate how institutional work to develop digital business-to-government reporting across the jurisdictions was shaped by international influences and local factors. We also illuminate how actor engagement issues and the intertwined and mutually reinforcing nature of a mosaic of forms of institutional work shaped the path of these transformations.

Biofuel policies play an important role in ethanol production, consumption, and investment in processing capacity. Nevertheless, a clear understanding of how current policies affect the evolution of the market is lacking. We developed a spatially-explicit agent-based model to analyze the impact of different blend mandates and taxes levied on gasoline, hydrous, and anhydrous ethanol on investment in processing capacity and on production and consumption of ethanol. The model uses land use projections by the PCRaster Land Use Change model and incorporates the institutions governing the actors’ strategic decision making with regard to production and consumption of ethanol, and the institutions governing the interaction among actors. From the investigated mix of policy measures, we find that an increase of the gasoline tax leads to the highest increased investments in sugarcane processing capacity. We also find that a gasoline tax above 1.23 R$/l and a tax exemption for hydrous ethanol may lead to doubling the production of ethanol by 2030 (relative to 2016). © 2018 The Authors",Agent-based modeling; Biofuel policies; Brazil; Ethanol; Institutional analysis; Supply chain,Autonomous agents; Biofuels; Computational methods; Decision making; Ethanol; Gasoline; Investments; Land use; Molasses; Supply chains; Taxation; Agent-based model; Biofuel policies; Brazil; Institutional analysis; Land use change modeling; Processing capacities; Production and consumption; Strategic decision making; Energy policy; biofuel; energy policy; ethanol; fuel consumption; institutional framework; supply chain management; Brazil,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054174220

This approach has been criticized for failing to consider that private choices may not fully reflect citizens’ preferences over public goods and means, a concept known as the consumer-citizen duality. Recent empirical evidence has established that individuals do indeed assign comparatively more value to safety in their role as citizens than in their role as drivers. Our study aims to provide explanations for this finding by presenting four stated choice experiments in which respondents were asked to make choices, both as citizens and as drivers, between routes that differed in travel time and safety. Subsequently, respondents were asked to provide reasons for their choices. We identify five cognitive and five normative explanations. The cognitive explanations suggest that individuals make diverging choices because their perceptions of accident risk differ between the two roles. Drivers will assign a relatively low value to mitigating accident risk because they believe that: (1) such risks are trivial on an individual level; (2) their personal risk is lower than the average risk; (3) their personal risk is controllable; (4) they would not be able to distinguish relative safety levels in real life; and (5) their choices for others are more risk-averse than choices for themselves and, unlike citizens, they are not explicitly evaluating risky choices for others. The normative explanations involve that individuals believe that the government should assign more value to safety compared to individual drivers because: (6) as citizen they are more prone to base their choices on social norms which prescribe risk-averse behaviour in this context; (7) governments have a duty of care concerning the safety of the transportation network; (8) drivers have a relatively high degree of responsibility to reduce their own travel times; (9) governments should account for drivers’ tendencies to choose faster routes by building safer ones; and (10) governments should ensure the safety of the road network because this allows drivers to choose the fastest route without being concerned about the impact of their route choice on accident risk. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Accident risk valuation; Consumer-citizen duality; Cost-benefit analysis; Economic evaluation accident risk; Transport appraisal,"Accidents; Economic analysis; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Traffic control; Transportation routes; Travel time; Accident risks; Consumer-citizen duality; Individual levels; Personal risks; Stated choice experiments; Transport appraisals; Transportation network; Transportation projects; Cost benefit analysis; adult; aged; car driving; delay discounting; environmental planning; female; high risk behavior; human; male; middle aged; psychology; risk assessment; safety; time factor; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Adult; Aged; Automobile Driving; Delay Discounting; Environment Design; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Assessment; Risk-Taking; Safety; Time Factors",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053304826

This paves a new way for using biotechnologies safely. However, the Safe-by-Design approach moves the bulk of the responsibility for safety to the actors in the research and development phase. Also, it assumes that safety can be defined and understood by all stakeholders in the same way. These assumptions are problematic and might actually undermine safety. This research explores these assumptions through the use of a Group Decision Room. In this set up, anonymous and non-anonymous deliberation methods are used for different stakeholders to exchange views. During the session, a potential synthetic biology application is used as a case for investigation: the Food Warden, a biosensor contained in meat packaging for indicating the freshness of meat. Participants discuss what potential issues might arise, how responsibilities should be distributed in a forward-looking way, who is to blame if something would go wrong. They are also asked what safety and responsibility mean at different phases, and for different stakeholders. The results of the session are not generalizable, but provide valuable insights. Issues of safety cannot all be taken care of in the R&D phase. Also, when things go wrong, there are proximal and distal causes to consider. In addition, capacities of actors play an important role in defining their responsibilities. Last but not least, this research provides a new perspective on the role of instruction manuals in achieving safety. © 2017, The Author(s).",Group decision room; Moral responsibility; Safe-by-Design; Synthetic biology; Uncertainty,"attitude; biotechnology; decision making; ethics; food safety; genetic procedures; human; meat industry; personnel; research ethics; social responsibility; stakeholder engagement; synthetic biology; Attitude; Biosensing Techniques; Biotechnology; Decision Making; Ethics, Research; Food Safety; Humans; Meat-Packing Industry; Research Personnel; Social Responsibility; Stakeholder Participation; Synthetic Biology",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029900355

However, data on the wide variety of indicators must be collected regularly, in a robust manner, comparable across but also within countries and at different administrative and disaggregated levels for adequate decision making to take place. Traditional census and household survey data is not enough. The increase in Small and Big Data streams have the potential to complement official statistics. The purpose of this research is to develop and evaluate a framework to characterize a data ecosystem in a developing country in its totality and to show how this can be used to identify data, outside the official statistics realm, that enriches the reporting on SDG indicators. Our method consisted of a literature study and an interpretative case study (two workshops with 60 and 35 participants and including two questionnaires, over 20 consultations and desk research). We focused on SDG 6.1.1. (Proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services) in rural Malawi. We propose a framework with five dimensions (actors, data supply, data infrastructure, data demand and data ecosystem governance). Results showed that many governmental and NGO actors are involved in water supply projects with different funding sources and little overall governance. There is a large variety of geospatial data sharing platforms and online accessible information management systems with however a low adoption due to limited internet connectivity and low data literacy. Lots of data is still not open. All this results in an immature data ecosystem. The characterization of the data ecosystem using the framework proves useful as it unveils gaps in data at geographical level and in terms of dimensionality (attributes per water point) as well as collaboration gaps. The data supply dimension of the framework allows identification of those datasets that have the right quality and lowest cost of data extraction to enrich official statistics. Overall, our analysis of the Malawian case study illustrated the complexities involved in achieving self-regulation through interaction, feedback and networked relationships. Additional complexities, typical for developing countries, include fragmentation, divide between governmental and non-governmental data activities, complex funding relationships and a data poor context. © 2018 by the authors.",Big data; Data collaborative; Data ecosystem; Data infrastructure; Data preparedness; Official statistics; Small data; Sustainable development goals; Volunteered geographic information,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85061426727

These problems relate to the ineffectiveness of the underlying institutions in this dynamic, multi-actor context. Institutions need to be considered during problem solving; however, peri-urban communities have limited insight into their institutional context. This research examines the extent to which problem solving capacity can be improved through gaming-simulation methods. A game-based approach is tested in a capacity building workshop with peri-urban communities in Khulna (Bangladesh). A role-playing game designed from game theory models is used to examine local drinking water problems through an institutional lens. Workshop evaluation shows that through role-play, participants learned about strategies in drinking water supply (in both the current and future scenarios) and about the potential to address water quality issues through cooperative groundwater monitoring. Results also show improved problem understanding with regards to institutions, actor strategies, and problem-solving constraints. Participants valued the interactive medium for comparing and evaluating strategies. This paper highlights limitations in game design and its implementation, and offers ways to address this in future applications. © 2018 by the authors.",Capacity building; Drinking water management; Gaming-simulation; Groundwater; Institutions; Peri-urban,Game theory; Groundwater; Potable water; Societies and institutions; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Capacity building; Game-based approaches; Gaming simulation; Groundwater monitoring; Institutional contexts; Peri-urban; Problem understanding; Water quality issues; Problem solving; capacity building; drinking water; exploitation; game theory; groundwater resource; institutional framework; local participation; periurban area; simulation; water management; Bangladesh; Khulna [Bangladesh],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85057044880

Therefore, it has started to develop various eco-cities, low-carbon cities, and other types of sustainable cities. The massive launch of these sustainable initiatives, as well as the higher cost of these projects, requires the Chinese government to invest large sums of money. What financial toolkits can be employed to fund this construction has become a critical issue. Against this backdrop, the authors have selected Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-city (SSTEC) and Shenzhen International Low-Carbon City (ILCC) and compared how they finance their construction. Both are thus far considered to be successful cases. The results show that the two cases differ from each other in two key aspects. First, ILCC has developed a model with less financial and other supports from the Chinese central government and foreign governments than SSTEC, and, hence, may be more valuable as a source of inspiration for other similar projects for which political support at the national level is not always available. Second, by issuing bonds in the international capital market, SSTEC singles itself out among various sustainable initiatives in China, while planning the village area as a whole and the metro plus property model are distinct practices in ILCC. In the end, the authors present a generic financing model that considers not only economic returns but also social and environmental impacts to facilitate future initiatives to finance in more structural ways. © 2018 by the authors.",Bonds; Finance; Public private partnerships; Shenzhen; Sustainable cities; Tianjin,capital market; comparative study; economic conditions; environmental impact; public-private partnership; sustainability; urban area; urbanization; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Tianjin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056733614

The impact and suitability of such technologies for a given area heavily depend on local conditions, such as characteristics of local demand. In particular, the shape of a local demand profile is an important determinant for how much renewable energy can be used directly, and how charging of electric vehicles and use of electric heating affect a local grid. Unfortunately, a systematic understanding of local demand characteristics on different urban scales (neighbourhoods, districts and municipalities) is currently lacking in literature. Most energy transition studies simplify local demand to household demand only. This paper addresses this knowledge gap by providing a novel data-driven classification and analysis of demand profiles and energy user compositions in nearly 15000 neighbourhoods, districts and municipalities, based on data from the Netherlands. The results show that on all urban scales, three types of areas can be distinguished. In this paper, these area types are termed “residential” “business” and “mixed” based on the most prevalent energy users in each. Statistic analysis of the results shows that area types are pairwise significantly different, both in terms of their profiles and in terms of their energy user composition. Moreover, residential-type demand profiles are found only in a small number of areas. These results emphasise the importance of using local detailed spatio-temporal demand profiles to support the transition of urban areas to sustainable energy generation, transportation and heating. To facilitate the implementation of the obtained insights in other models, a spreadsheet modelling tool is provided in an addendum to this paper. © 2018 The Authors",Clustering; Electricity demand profile; Energy transition; Spatio-temporal demand; Urban energy,Electric power utilization; Heating; Housing; Renewable energy resources; Vehicle-to-grid; Clustering; Electricity demands; Energy transitions; Spatio temporal; Urban energy; Urban transportation; cluster analysis; demand analysis; electric vehicle; electricity generation; heating; household energy; knowledge; renewable resource; smart grid; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; sustainability; urban area; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053143062

However, when available resources are not adequate, fire brigades would need to optimally allocate their resources by answering the question ""which burning units to suppress first and which exposed units to cool first?"" until more resources become available from nearby industrial plants or residential communities. The present study is an attempt to answer the foregoing question by developing a graph theoretic methodology.

Research findings attribute weak CS influence to the restriction of citizen actions to data collection, with minimal or no engagement in co-design, co-creation, data analysis, and elucidation of results. We design a participatory GIS and CS methodology aimed at engaging the citizens in the entire Earth Observation (EO) project cycle. The methodology also seeks to address previous CS project challenges related to data quality, data interoperability, citizen-motivation, and participation. We draw the high-level requirements from the SENDAI framework of action and the three pillars of active citizen engagement, as enshrined in Principle 10 of the Rio Declaration and the Aarhus Convention. The primary input of the methodology is the Haklay (2018) approach for participatory mapping and CS, and the Reed (2009) stakeholder analysis framework. The proposed methodology comprises of three main parts: system analysis, stakeholder analysis, and a six-step methodology. We designed the six-step methodology using an iterative and flexible approach, to take account of unforeseen changes.

However, debates reflect concerns that they affect social and moral values such as privacy and justice. The energy justice framework has been proposed as a lens to evaluate social and moral aspects of changes in energy systems. This paper seeks to investigate this proposition for smart grid systems by exploring the public debates in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. Findings show that smart grids have the potential to effectively address justice issues, for example by facilitating small-scale electricity generation and transparent and reliable billing. It is a matter of debate, however, whether current smart grid designs contribute to cost and energy savings, advance a more equitable and democratic energy system, or reinforce distributive and procedural injustices. The increased use of information and communication technology raises value conflicts on privacy and cyber security, which are related to energy justice. This research contributes by conceptualizing energy justice in the context of smart grids for the first time. The energy justice framework is broadened by including values and value conflicts that pertain directly to the increased use of information and communication technology. For policy makers and designers of smart grids, the paper provides guidance for considering interconnected social and moral values in the design of policies and smart grid technologies. © 2018 The Authors",Content analysis; Energy justice; Public debate; Smart grid systems; Sustainability; Values,Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Information use; Security of data; Sustainable development; Content analysis; Energy justices; Public debate; Smart grid systems; Values; Smart power grids; alternative energy; electricity generation; energy conservation; energy policy; information and communication technology; policy making; smart grid; sustainability; technological change; Netherlands; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053342150

It is increasingly asserted that paying due attention to the moral values involved in controversial energy cases may increase social acceptance. Value-sensitive design (VSD) has been recommended as a promising approach for addressing moral values in controversial energy cases. This paper aims to empirically explore the applicability of VSD in controversial energy cases by investigating the extent to which it is possible to identify the relevant values, norms and design requirements in the Groningen gas controversy (the Netherlands) using values hierarchies. It was found in this case that the relevant values, norms and design requirements could be retrieved, but that two conditions need to be fulfilled to avoid underexposure of relevant values. Firstly, data should be collected using a variety of data sources. Secondly, these sources should be analyzed through both top-down approaches and bottom-up approaches. We find that ‘Safety’ is a critical value in the Groningen case, while other critical values are related to securing ‘Procedural Justice’. Strikingly, the important procedural values ‘Trust’ and ‘Honesty’ did not translate into concrete policies. Policy makers can use values hierarchies to address moral values in energy cases and to translate these values into concrete measures. © 2018 The Author(s)",Energy controversy; Groningen gas case; Social acceptance; Value-sensitive design; Values hierarchy,Energy policy; Bottom up approach; Critical value; Energy controversy; Procedural justice; Social acceptance; Top down approaches; Value sensitive design; Values hierarchy; Social aspects; bottom-up approach; design; energy policy; morality; public attitude; Groningen [Netherlands]; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052135485

This paper aims to reveal how municipality size influences municipalities' motivation perspectives on opening up municipality data. To this end, Q-methodology is used, which is a method that is suited to objectify people's frames of mind on a particular topic. By applying this method to 37 municipalities in the Netherlands, we elicited the motivation perspectives of three main groups of municipalities: (1) advocating municipalities, (2) careful municipalities, and (3) conservative municipalities. We found that advocating municipalities are mainly large-sized municipalities (> 65,000 inhabitants) and a few small-sized municipalities (< 35,000 inhabitants). Careful municipalities concern municipalities of all sizes (small, medium, and large). The conservative municipality perspective is more common among smaller-sized municipalities. Our findings do not support the statement ""the smaller the municipality, the less motivated it is to open up its data"". However, the type and amount of municipality resources do influence motivations to share data or not. We provide recommendations for how open data policy makers on the national level need to support the three groups of municipalities and municipalities of different sizes in different ways to stimulate the provision of municipal data to the public as much as possible. Moreover, if national governments can identify which municipalities adhere to which motivation perspective, they can then develop more targeted open data policies that meet the requirements of the municipalities that adhere to each perspective. This should result in more open data value creation. © 2018 by the authors.",Motivation; Municipality; Open cities; Open data; Open government data; Perspective; Policy; Q-methodology; Size,Public policy; Municipality; Open cities; Open datum; Open government data; Perspective; Q-methodology; Size; Motivation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056096828

Despite the company's efforts to improve occupational safety, accidents with pallet movers remain noteworthy. In order to control occupational accidents, it is crucial to have a clear view of the potential accident scenarios that are present in a company. The bow-tie method is a way to capture and visualize these accident processes in an integrative way. Included in the bow-tie are safety barriers (both technical as organizational and human) and management delivery systems that can intervene in these accident processes. Once bow-ties are composed, they are an excellent point of departure to assign indicators to the safety barriers and management delivery systems in order to control (i.e., prevent or mitigate) accident scenarios. Two types of indicators can be distinguished. Firstly, there are general indicators that are assigned to management delivery systems interrupting multiple accident scenarios, which can yield a higher safety gain (as they intervene in multiple accident scenarios). Secondly, there are scenario-specific indicators targeting one specific accident scenario, which can be valuable as they target a specific problem in the company. For the development of the bow-ties, a multi-method design with the inclusion of different data sources was used, leading to a comprehensive overview. This makes the bow-tie analysis of internal transport with pallet movers transferable to other settings where pallet movers are used for internal transport. © 2018 by the authors.",Accident analysis; Bow-tie analysis; Manufacturing industry; Pallet mover accidents; Safety barriers,Accident prevention; Manufacture; Occupational risks; Pallets; Accident analysis; Belgian manufacturing; Bow-tie analysis; Manufacturing industries; Occupational accident; Occupational safety; Point of departures; Safety barriers; Accidents,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054909769

In this paper, a method called the ""Evacuation Diagram"" is described to support risk-based evacuation planning and decision-making. In case of an imminent threat of flooding, we refer to the conditional risk, which is the risk given the forecasted water levels and potential consequences during the next days of the event. Given the threat and potential costs and benefits, evacuation decisions have to mitigate this conditional risk. Since evacuation can be costly, decisionmakers have to make a trade-offbetween costs and benefits. In this research we present a method using a cost-benefit analysis approach, in which we adopt the ""Dutch flood risk approach"" to define the required strength of levees based on flood risk considerations. The ""Evacuation Diagram"" method is derived from analytical derivations, based on differential weighing of costs and benefits, which have an impact on a binary choice (or a set of discrete choices) as to whether to instruct an area to evacuate or not. Basically, this is an analysis of behavioural decision-making under risk, investigating how a cost-benefit analysis can yield higher cost effectiveness in risk reduction for human lives lost during possible evacuation incidents. The method is applied to a Dutch case study and the results are compared to the outcomes of the largest evacuation exercise ever held in the Netherlands, called 'Waterproef'. It is concluded that the risk-based evacuation method, as presented in this paper, provides useful insight into collective and authoritative evacuation order decisions. © 2018 by the authors.",Cost-benefit-analysis; Evacuation; Flood risk; Probabilistic analysis,Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Floods; Risk assessment; Water levels; Costs and benefits; Decision-making under risks; Emergency response; Evacuation; Evacuation planning; Flood risks; Probabilistic analysis; Risk based decision making; Cost benefit analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054712222

In this context, managing chemical risk is especially important towards preventing both occupational accidents and major accidents. Directive 89/391/EEC and Directive 2012/18/EU, respectively, are enforced in the European Union (EU) to this end. These directives may be further complemented by the recent ISO 45001:2018 standard regarding occupational health and safety management systems. These three management systems are closely related. However, scientific literature tackles the researching of these accidents independently. Thus, the main objective of this work is to identify and analyse the links and transitional spaces between the risk management of both types of accident. Among the results obtained, three transitional spaces can be pointed out which result from the intersection of the three systems mentioned. Similarly, the intersection of these spaces gives shape to a specific transitional space defined by the individual directives linked to Directive 89/391/EEC. These results are limited from a regulatory and technical perspective.

This paper proposes an alternative class of stochastic frontier estimators, based on the notion that some observations contain more information than others about the true frontier. If an observation is likely to contain much information, it is assigned a large weight in the regression analysis. In order to establish the weights, we propose an iterative procedure. The advantages of this more intuitive approach are its transparency and its easy application. The method is applied to Dutch local administrative services (LAS) in municipalities. The method converges quickly and produces reliable estimates. About 25% of the LAS are designated as efficient. The average efficiency score is 93%.

Such empirical evidence is critical for assessing previous and candidate future land use-transport policies. Existing research however, has mostly investigated travel behaviour during relatively short time periods and for a single transport mode. This paper examines the development of travel behaviour and its socio-demographic and location determinants, using Dutch National Travel Survey data from 1980 to 2010 among other sources, for the Randstad, the Netherlands. A pseudo panel analysis is conducted to investigate the effect of various indicators on average daily distance travelled by train, car and bicycle over three decades. Econometric models including pooled ordinary least squares, fixed and random effects and a hybrid model were tested to identify the best fit. The results indicate that average daily distance travelled rose until the mid-1990s before witnessing a decrease till 2010. Interestingly, half of the Randstad inhabitants have been travelling ≤26 km per day over the past thirty years. Furthermore, as people grow older, they increasingly travel more by train and bicycle. Finally, a rise in suburban inhabitants decreases the average distance travelled by train and increases that of bicycle, while a rise in rural inhabitants encourages higher distances travelled by car. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Daily travel distance; Hybrid fixed- and random-effects; Land use; Long term; Pseudo panel analysis; Randstad,econometrics; land use; numerical model; residential location; transportation infrastructure; transportation policy; travel behavior; urban development; Netherlands; Randstad,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053828533

This study assesses the extent to which ES were considered by key policy actors involved in the strategic decision-making process leading to an innovative large-scale Dutch coastal management project. We analysed retrospective interviews to ascertain which ES were considered and how they were described by policy actors. Over half of the quotes (118/228) and 16 out of the 17 interviewees referred to three broad ES categories, with high degrees of adoption: coastal safety, recreation and cognitive development (learning by doing). The broad terms ‘nature’ and ‘spatial quality’ were also referenced often (36 times). Our findings suggest that broad, unspecified ecosystem services were adopted highly by the policy actors, while specific ecosystem service categories were rarely considered. Relatable and comprehensible cultural ecosystem services also constituted critical arguments for policy actors in their strategic decision making. We reflect that ambiguous, broad terms can help to garner support and unite efforts across disciplinary and institutional boundaries. For ES to align with relevant aspects of decision making, a ‘translation step’ between ES research and decision making might be required and ambiguity should be acknowledged. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Ambiguity; Boundary object; Coastal management; Ecological engineering; Nature-based solutions; Science-policy interface,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053454584

However, empirical evidence for this is largely lacking. This study intends to fill this gap by assessing the impact of business models, in particular battery and vehicle leasing, on Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption. By conducting a stated choice experiment, we examine to what extent car drivers switch their choices between conventional and electric vehicles after business models become available. The results based on the discrete choice model suggest that leasing does not increase EV adoption at the aggregate level. However, a latent transition analysis shows that different groups with internally homogeneous preferences react differently to leasing options at the disaggregate level. The results indicate that 13% of the car drivers changed their preferences, albeit in different ways. Transition probabilities are particularly related to attitudes towards leasing and knowledge of EV. The results show that leasing is useful in facilitating EV adoption for certain groups, which can be identified by their individual characteristics. In addition to these substantial insights, this paper makes a contribution to the literature by demonstrating the potential of latent transition analysis in uncovering heterogeneity in behavioral changes induced by policy or strategy interventions, especially when changes can occur in opposite directions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Business model; Electric vehicle; Latent transition analysis; Lease,Electric automobiles; Electric switches; Electric vehicles; Behavioral changes; Business modeling; Discrete choice models; Individual characteristics; Lease; Stated choice experiments; Transition analysis; Transition probabilities; Automotive industry; business; car use; discrete choice analysis; electric vehicle; heterogeneity; policy strategy; technology adoption; transportation planning; transportation technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049947256

Forty-two volunteers participated in our research who completed thirty successful (complete crossing) trials in blocks of ten trials for each crossing condition. For the two distracted conditions, pedestrians are engaged in a maze-solving game on a virtual smartphone, while at the same time checking the traffic for a safe crossing gap. For the proposed safety measure, smart flashing and color changing LED lights are simulated on the crosswalk to warn the distracted pedestrian who initiates crossing. Surrogate safety measures as well as speed information and distraction attributes such as direction and orientation of participant's head were collected and evaluated by employing a Multinomial Logit (MNL) model. Results from the model indicate that females have more dangerous crossing behaviour especially in distracted conditions; however, the smart LED treatment reduces this negative impact. Moreover, the number of times and the percentage of duration the head was facing the smartphone during a trial and a waiting time respectively increase the possibility of unsafe crossings; though, the proposed treatment reduces the safety crossing rate. Hence, our study shows that the smart LED light safety treatment indeed improves the safety of distracted pedestrians and enhances the successful crossing rate. © 2018",Distracted street crossing; Head-mounted immersive virtual reality; Multi-tasking; Pedestrian; Smart LED lights safety treatment; Smartphone use; Surrogate analysis,Civil defense; Light emitting diodes; Roads and streets; Smartphones; Virtual reality; Immersive virtual reality; Pedestrian; Safety treatments; Street crossing; Surrogate analysis; Pedestrian safety,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048946639

Contrary to popular belief, these emotions can have a systematic base. Bringing together insights from appraisal theory and from technology acceptance studies, this study develops and tests hypotheses regarding antecedents of anger, fear, joy, and pride about a local hydrogen fuel station (HFS). A questionnaire study was conducted among 271 citizens living near the first publicly accessible HFS in the Netherlands, around the time of its implementation. The results show that anger is significantly explained by (from stronger to weaker effects) perceived procedural and distributive unfairness, and fear by distributive unfairness, perceived safety, procedural unfairness, gender, and prior awareness. Joy is significantly explained by perceived environmental outcomes and perceived usefulness, and pride by prior awareness, perceived risks, trust in industry, and perceived usefulness. The study concludes that these predictors are understandable practical and moral considerations, which can and should be taken into account when developing and executing a project. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Emotions; Fairness; Hydrogen; Perceived risks,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046832683

These connections have been seminally observed and exploited by Marcus Kracht, in the context of his characterization of the modal axioms (which he calls primitive formulas) which can be effectively transformed into 'analytic'structural rules of display calculi. In this context, a rule is 'analytic'if adding it to a display calculus preserves Belnap's cut-elimination theorem. In recent years, the state-of-the-art in correspondence theory has been uniformly extended from classical modal logic to diverse families of non-classical logics, ranging from (bi-)intuitionistic (modal) logics, linear, relevant and other substructural logics, to hybrid logics and mu-calculi. This generalization has given rise to a theory called unified correspondence, the most important technical tools of which are the algorithm ALBA, and the syntactic characterization of Sahlqvist-type classes of formulas and inequalities which is uniform in the setting of normal DLE-logics (logics the algebraic semantics of which is based on bounded distributive lattices). We apply unified correspondence theory, with its tools and insights, to extend Kracht's results and prove his claims in the setting of DLE-logics. The results of the present article characterize the space of properly displayable DLE-logics. © The Author(s) 2018.",Display calculi; distributive lattice expansions; properly displayable logics; unified correspondence,Biomineralization; Calculations; Computer circuits; Formal logic; Pathology; Semantics; Bounded distributive lattice; Classical modal logic; Cut-elimination theorem; Display calculus; Distributive lattice; properly displayable logics; Syntactic characterization; unified correspondence; Lattice theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026755602

Its municipalities hope to attract investors, firms, high-quality labour force and residents in line with ecological modernization. They do so by using a variety of attractive city labels, such as eco city, low carbon city, and smart city. The physical shape these city labels take is best exemplified in the emergence of large new towns at the fringes of existing urban areas. Few studies to date unearth empirical evidence as to how municipal governments in China implement their smart eco city ambitions. This study does precisely that by examining how concrete policy networks at the local level develop new towns in the Pearl River Delta. The Policy Network Theory is used to map the positions actors have in three different new town projects in Shenzhen, Foshan, and Zhuhai respectively. It explains project progress or lack thereof by studying the organizational constellations that structure the interactions among actors and how the constellations affect their resources exchange. Our analysis suggests that in the various arenas where policy actors meet each other and are supposed to exchange resources and work out viable policy packages, blockades exist preventing such exchanges from happening. This creates impasses to which different cities have found different institutional and organizational answers. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Eco city; New town development; Policy instruments; Policy network theory; Smart city; Sustainable city,Circuit theory; Smart city; Urban growth; Eco cities; New town development; Policy instruments; Policy networks; Sustainable cities; Ecology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048273974

The ‘emergency evacuation’ term has been defined as ‘a critical movement of people from a dangerous area due to the risk or an incident of a tragic event’ (Bonabeau, 2002). An emergency evacuation could be needed in a life or death situation, regardless if it begins with a natural non-intended incident or a terrorist attack. Many researchers have studied the behaviour of the people during the evacuation because of several incidents with panic attacks that have led to injuries including death of people being crushed or trampled down by others. In crisis situation, the perception of the indoor environment, which differs from person to person, play a critical role in the evacuation. Also, the access rights of the indoor spaces are different from those rights (and restrictions) during normal times. They may positively impact the movements of the people during the evacuation by providing suggestions for shorter/better route. This paper addresses the impact of the access rights of the indoor spaces during an emergency evacuation. We employ the conceptual model of LADM-IndoorGML that defines the accessibility of the indoor spaces based on the rights, restrictions, and responsibilities of the user of the indoor space. The access rights of the indoor spaces are affected by the crisis event and this needs to be modelled explicitly (and before crisis situation). Actually, the rights/restrictions persons have on spaces is time dependent: normal operation hours, outside normal operation hours (e.g. during night time in case of a University building) or during crisis times. These actual/valid rights and restrictions affect the movement / accessibility of the users to reach the nearest emergency exits or the safe zone. For this reason, different scenarios have to be developed to study the impact of the accessibilities for different types of users. In this paper we will present the 3D model of an educational building that was built for the purpose of evacuation study. The 3D model is supported by real data for all spaces from the facility management department such as information on departments, sections, groups of users (visitors, employees, and students), and public/private spaces, etc. and a real evacuation exercise. We consider it extremely important to develop our information model based on international standards (LADM/ISO 19152, OGC IndoorGML, ISO 19141, ISO 19107) as we expect that this information will be part of the future ‘building infrastructure’ and applications all over the world can understand and use this data when entering or leaving a certain building both during normal and crisis situations. Different types of applications are anticipated to be based on this information model; e.g. mobile indoor routing app (for normal building users and Emergency Response Team members), crisis evacuation desktop application for command centre, etc. © Authors 2018.",Access; Indoor modelling; IndoorGML; LADM; Security; UML,College buildings; Human resource management; Information theory; Office buildings; Terrorism; Access; Desktop applications; Educational buildings; IndoorGML; Information Modeling; International standards; LADM; Security; Behavioral research,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85056173269

The results of the optimizations showed strong reasoning for islands to invest in renewable energy technologies (particularly wind energy), as compared to conventional power generation. Levelized cost of systems for electricity generation decrease considerably with increasing renewable energy penetrations, to an optimal point in the range of 40–80% penetration. Furthermore, renewable electricity integration in the order of 60–90% could still be achieved with no added cost from the initial situation. Cost increases after these optimal points are attributed to the growing inclusion of storage, required to meet the higher renewable energy shares. However, with battery costs forecast to fall in the coming years, and a cost reduction of 50–70% already causing lithium-ion batteries to overtake pumped hydro as a cost-favorable storage option in this model, there is a real case for islands to begin their transition in a staged process; first installing wind and PV generation, and then - as storage costs decrease and their renewable energy capacities increase - investing in storage options. © 2018 The Authors",Cost optimization; Hybrid power plants; Island energy systems; Lithium-ion battery storage; Pumped-hydro storage; Renewable electricity systems,Cost reduction; Lithium-ion batteries; Photovoltaic cells; Wind power; Cost optimization; Electricity generation; Energy systems; Hybrid power plants; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy capacity; Renewable energy penetrations; Renewable energy technologies; Battery storage; cost analysis; electricity generation; equipment component; island; lithium; penetration; photovoltaic system; power plant; pumping; renewable resource; wind power,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048191477

To investigate what local energy planning and implementation processes look like in the post-liberalisation era we conduct a systematic literature review by addressing the question 'which institutional settings of local renewable energy planning and implementation in the EU's post-liberalisation area has prior empirical research identified?' For this systematic analysis we conceptualised the analytic concept 'action situation' (as developed by Elinor Ostrom), from an energy governance and energy policy perspective. The literature review was conducted in two cycles: A systematic database search and snowballing. Four clusters of search terms were used to search two databases. The selected articles were coded using Atlas.ti. Our in-depth qualitative analysis revealed the institutional arrangements used in the reported local energy planning processes were found to not be ideal for the introduction of renewable energy technologies. No type of actor group seems actively to support the realisation of renewable energy projects. Moreover, a high dependence on financial subsidies was found. These results are useful for practitioners and policy-makers as they show which possibilities and limitations stakeholders encounter in the changed level playing field of local energy planning. The article also presents propositions for future research. © 2018 by the authors.",Electricity market; Implementation; Institutions; Liberalisation; Local energy planning; Local governance; Renewable energy; Renewable energy technologies; Systematic literature review,alternative energy; database; energy planning; energy policy; European Union; governance approach; implementation process; liberalization; literature review; qualitative analysis,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053155569

At present, however, only two large-scale power plants capture a total of 2.4 Mt CO2/a. Several reasons are identified for this mismatch between expectations and realised deployment. Applying bibliographic coupling, the research front of CCS, understood to be published peer-reviewed papers, is explored to scrutinise whether the current research is sufficient to meet these problems. The analysis reveals that research is dominated by technical research (69%). Only 31% of papers address non-technical issues, particularly exploring public perception, policy, and regulation, providing a broader view on CCS implementation on the regional or national level, or using assessment frameworks. This shows that the research is advancing and attempting to meet the outlined problems, which are mainly non-technology related. In addition to strengthening this research, the proportion of papers that adopt a holistic approach may be increased in a bid to meet the challenges involved in transforming a complex energy system. It may also be useful to include a broad variety of stakeholders in research so as to provide a more resilient development of CCS deployment strategies. © 2018 by the authors.",Bibliographic coupling; Bibliometrics; Carbon capture and storage; Citations; Deployment of CCS; Expectation and reality; Review,Bibliographies; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Reviews; Bibliographic couplings; Bibliometrics; Citations; Deployment of CCS; Expectation and reality; Carbon capture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85054033679

Monitoring and timely detection of relevant changes, and critical transitions or tipping points is crucial to ensure successful and timely implementation and reassessment of the plan. Although efforts have been made to identify signposts to monitor, the question remains how to design a signal monitoring system that detects and anticipates (future) change to support adaptive planning. For example, to support water related infrastructure investments under uncertain climate change. What are good signposts to monitor and how to wisely analyse them to get timely and reliable signals for adaptation? In this paper, we present a framework for designing and using a monitoring plan as part of the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways (DAPP) approach for decision making under uncertainty. We use the following criteria to evaluate signposts and their critical signal values: measurability, timeliness, reliability, convincibility and institutional connectivity.

This workshop discussed the growing importance of market initiative regimes in public transport focussing on the market and regulatory developments in three sectors: local and regional bus, long-distance coach and passenger train services. The comparison of these sectors illustrated impressive but also very substantial differences between countries in terms of market potentials, success of market initiative, regulatory paths taken and resulting performance. Various observations were made. The size and stratification of passenger transports markets in most countries or regions studied seemed to leave little room for direct intramodal competition, while there was more trust in the viability of intermodal competition. The lack of data was perceived to be a major issue, not only for research but also for market transparency and well-functioning. The development of new intermediaries for information and ticketing purposes seems to point at a possible gradual replacement of the ‘old’ public transport integration dogma with some new paradigm. There is still a lack of academic studies focussing on the process leading to demand and supply of regulation of market initiative regimes and of studies looking subsequently at the factors leading to the uptake of such regulatory tools or at the practical requirements for such specific regulations to function. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Competition; Governance; Incentives; Market initiative; Public transport,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85052243687

Having a better sense of the existing flows over the network would allow for much improved modelling of future flows and nudging users into behaviours targeting collectively better outcomes. Because of this promise the interest that cities have in big data for mobility is high. They are looking for ways in which a mobility data platform gathers the relevant data, allow for advanced modelling of current and future network states, and ways to drive travel behaviour. We participated in the EU funded PETRA project that built such a platform for the cities of Haifa, Rome and Venice. In this paper, we are looking for key governance mechanisms that affect the success of mobility data platforms, and how they are related to technical features. The project and an additional study into 10 cases revealed that the more ambitious a platform is on a technical level, the more governance challenges they will encounter, thus the more advanced governance arrangements are necessary. However, many governance arrangements are a given rather than a subject to design. This implies that for success, the technical ambition of the platform should be aligned with the institutions of the city in which the platforms will be implemented. © 2018 The Authors",Big data; Data platforms; Governance-mobility; Institutions; Smart cities,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050799629

The academic field that addresses these problems—which we tentatively call ‘digital ethics’—can be an important intellectual resource for policy making and regulation. This is why it is important to understand how the new ethical challenges of a digital society are being met by academic research. We have undertaken a scientometric analysis to arrive at a better understanding of the nature, scope and dynamics of the field of digital ethics. Our approach in this paper shows how the field of digital ethics is distributed over various academic disciplines. By first having experts select a collection of keywords central to digital ethics, we have generated a dataset of articles discussing these issues. This approach allows us to generate a scientometric visualisation of the field of digital ethics, without being constrained by any preconceived definitions of academic disciplines. We have first of all found that the number of publications pertaining to digital ethics is exponentially increasing. We furthermore established that whereas one may expect digital ethics to be a species of ethics, we in fact found that the various questions pertaining to digital ethics are predominantly being discussed in computer science, law and biomedical science. It is in these fields, more than in the independent field of ethics, that ethical discourse is being developed around concrete and often technical issues. Moreover, it appears that some important ethical values are very prominent in one field (e.g., autonomy in medical science), while being almost absent in others. We conclude that to get a thorough understanding of, and grip on, all the hard ethical questions of a digital society, ethicists, policy makers and legal scholars will need to familiarize themselves with the concrete and practical work that is being done across a range of different scientific fields to deal with these questions. © 2018, The Author(s).",Data protection; Digital ethics’; GDPR; Inter-disciplinarity; Multi-disciplinarity; Privacy; Scientometrics; Term map,Concretes; Data privacy; Decision making; Network security; Digital ethics; GDPR; Inter-disciplinarity; Multi-disciplinarity; Scientometrics; Philosophical aspects,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049065463

However, variance-based GSA is highly computationally expensive. While different screening methods can estimate GSA results, these techniques typically impose restrictions on sampling methods and input types. As an alternative, this work evaluates two decision tree-based methods to approximate GSA results: random forests, and Extra-Trees. These techniques are applicable with common sampling methods, and continuous or categorical inputs. The tree-based methods are compared to reference Sobol GSA and Morris screening techniques, for three cases: an Ishigami-Homma function, a H1N1 pandemic model, and the CDICE integrated assessment model. The Extra-Trees algorithm performs favorably compared to Morris elementary effects, accurately approximating the relative importance of Sobol total effect indices. Furthermore, Extra-Trees can estimate variable interaction importances using a pairwise permutation measure. As such, this approach could offer a user-friendly option for screening in models with inputs of mixed types. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Decision tree methods; Ensemble learning methods; Factor screening; Global sensitivity analysis,Decision trees; Decision tree method; Ensemble learning; Factor screening; Global sensitivity analysis; Integrated assessment models; Parametric interactions; Performance comparison; Tree-based ensembles; Sensitivity analysis; algorithm; detection method; environmental modeling; numerical method; sampling; sensitivity analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048952644

Due to the existence of uncertainties, risk propagation can hardly be precisely and/or robustly assessed. Therefore, in this paper, considering that decision-makers prefer uncertainty-informed risk information rather than unreliable “precise” risk values, a new insight is provided to deal with risk assessment of the onshore pipeline maintenance process under uncertainty. The risk assessment model is built on the framework of quantitative risk assessment based on AHP and expert knowledge. Meanwhile, to represent and quantify uncertainty, interval analysis is utilized to extend the whole model into an interval environment. As a result, an interval quantified risk assessment model is established for the onshore pipeline maintenance process. The study shows that interval analysis can effectively internalize, represent, quantify and propagate the uncertainty in the risk assessment model. In the specific case of emergency maintenance for the Gangqing dual pipeline, the interval scores to respectively characterize the occurrence likelihood and consequence severity are computed. As a result, the uncertainty-informed overall risk of the emergency maintenance process is determined and intuitively pinpointed in an interval risk matrix. The risk rating of the case is estimated as Level 2, indicating that operations with respect to emergency maintenance are well organized and the possibility of accident occurrence is low. Thus, maintenance can be carried out well under supervision. Even if a secondary accident would occur, the accident scope will be quite small and emergency measures are adequate enough to control the development of the accident and reduce accident losses. Moreover, the sensitivity sorting of sub-indexes of occurrence likelihood is obtained as I11 &gt; I23 &gt; I13 &gt; I22 &gt; I34 &gt; I12 &gt; I33 &gt; I21 &gt; I31 &gt; I32, indicating that improvement in the management capacity (I11), normal operations (I13) and completeness of protection (I22) will effectively reduce the occurrence of accidents and improve operational safety. Furthermore, risk estimation under the condition of missing data is tackled by using Monte Carlo simulations and provides a reasonable option when crucial information is lacking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Interval analysis; Interval analytic hierarchical process; Pipeline maintenance; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty,Accidents; Gas pipelines; Intelligent systems; Maintenance; Monte Carlo methods; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gas transportation; Petroleum pipelines; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Uncertainty analysis; Analytic hierarchical process; Interval analysis; Maintenance process; Pipeline maintenance; Quantified risk assessments; Quantitative risk assessment; Risk assessment models; Uncertainty; Risk assessment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047007673

In doing so, the chapter builds on real examples from academic-policy engagement in the EU on energy demand, consumption and services. We examine three myths of the role of modelling in policymaking and propose practical ways of employing different types of modelling in a complementary way to increase policymakers' understanding of residential energy demand, consumption and services.

To implement them in a large scale, broad acceptance in societies is crucial. However, a growing body of research has revealed societal concerns with these technologies. To achieve sustainable energy systems, such concerns should be taken into account in the development of smart grid technologies. In this paper, we show that many concerns are related to moral values such as privacy, justice, or trust. We explore the effect of moral values on the acceptance of smart grid technologies. The results of our systematic literature review indicate that moral values can be both driving forces and barriers for smart grid acceptance. We propose that future research striving to understand the role of moral values as factors for social acceptance can benefit from an interdisciplinary approach bridging literature in ethics of technology with technology acceptance models. © 2018 by the authors.",Smart energy; Smart grid; Sustainability; Technology acceptance; Technology adoption; Values,alternative energy; electricity; implementation process; interdisciplinary approach; literature review; research work; smart grid; sustainability; technology adoption,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85051075912

Previous research based on cross-sectional data found that European citizens generally favour asylum seekers with high employability, severe vulnerabilities, and Christians over Muslims. These preferences and attitudes were found to be homogeneous across countries and socio-demographic groups. Here, we do not study the general acceptance of asylum seekers, but the acceptance of refugee and migrant homes in citizens’ vicinity and how it changes over time. Based on a repeated stated choice experiment on preferences for refugee and migrant homes, we show that the initially promoted “welcome culture” towards refugees in Germany was not reflected in the views of a majority of a sample of German citizens who rather disapproved refugee homes in their vicinity. Their preferences have not changed between November 2015, the peak of “welcome culture,” and November 2016, after political debates, media reporting and public discourse had shifted towards limiting admission of immigrants. A minority of one fifth of the sample population, who were initially rather approving of refugee and migrant homes being established in their vicinity, were more likely to change their preferences towards a rather disapproving position in 2016. Experience of contact with refugees and migrants, higher education, and general pro-immigration attitudes explain acceptance of refugee and migrant homes as well as preference stability over time. Country of origin and religion of refugees and migrants are considered less important than decent housing conditions and whether refugee and migrants arrive as families or single persons. In this respect our results highlight the importance of humanitarian aspects of sheltering and integration of refugees and other migrants into society. © 2018 Liebe et al.

Demands are stochastic, can be non-stationary, and are forecast using any model that provides the expected demands and their error term distribution, which can be any theoretical or empirical distribution. We offer a detailed discussion on the modeling of demand stochasticity, focusing on the probabilities and cost effects of undesirable events, such as stock-outs, breakdowns and route failures, and their associated recourse actions. Tractability is achieved through the ability to pre-compute or at least partially pre-process the stochastic information, which is possible under mild assumptions for a general inventory policy. We integrate the stochastic aspect into a mixed integer non-linear program, illustrate applications to various problem classes, and show how to model specific problems through the lens of inventory routing. The case study is based on two sets of realistic instances, representing a waste collection inventory routing problem and a facility maintenance problem, respectively. We analyze the effects of our assumptions on modeling realism and tractability, and demonstrate that our framework significantly outperforms deterministic policies in its ability to limit the number of undesirable events for the same routing cost. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Forecasting; Recourse; Rich routing problem; Stochastic demand; Tractability; Unified framework,Application programs; Distribution of goods; Forecasting; Integer programming; Linear programming; Nonlinear programming; Stochastic models; Recourse; Routing problems; Stochastic demand; Tractability; Unified framework; Stochastic systems; demand analysis; error analysis; forecasting method; inventory; numerical model; stochasticity; temporal analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048382315

However, there is little empirical evidence of such a trade-off, nor about the strength of the associated negative correlation and the importance employees attach to both properties. This paper intends to fill these knowledge gaps by studying employees’ trade-offs concerning the usability and security of TSMs within a discrete choice experiment (DCE) framework. In our DCE, employees are asked to indicate the most preferred security packages that describe combinations of TSMs. In addition, security and usability perceptions of the security packages are explicitly measured and modelled. The models estimated from these observed responses indicate how each TSM affects perceived security, perceived usability and preference. The paper further illustrates how the modelling results can be applied to design highly secure packages that are still preferred by employees. The paper also makes a methodological contribution to the literature by introducing discrete choice experiments to the field of information security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Discrete choice experiments; Discrete choice models; Employees’ preferences; Information security; Security measures; Security perception; Usability perception,Security of data; Usability engineering; Discrete choice experiments; Discrete choice models; Methodological contributions; Negative correlation; Perceived securities; Security and usabilities; Security measure; Usability and security; Economic and social effects,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046341835

It critically examines the assumptions of the public health discourse in the light of this couple’s attempts to balance love and health care within their relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The couple, the first two authors, put themselves under the magnifying glass. They arranged for a dialogic encounter and built a co-constructed auto-ethnography. This study consists of a “raw” narrative and a reflection. This reflexive part was added by the third author, interpreting the couple’s experiences applying in a sociocultural way theories of ethical care. This sheds light on ethical care aspects encountered in the couple’s balancing of love and health care. Findings: This study shows that the couple copes with adversity rather than being in control of it. Nonetheless their love relationship appears to be flourishing, thanks to their acknowledgement of the importance of mutual caring. Research limitations/implications: The current public health discourse puts the couple’s private love relationship under pressure. It turns a blind eye towards the difficulties they experience with the contemporary “self-management” paradigm. The couple feels that the government is an interloper intruding into their private relationship. This creates tension, friction, anxiety, as well as increasing the burden of the illness and makes them feel insecure and unsafe.

The transition towards a renewable energy system cannot be seen as a purely technical issue; it is strongly embedded within society. In this study, we analyze the stakeholder complexities of the transition in urban districts and research the use of a simulation game to increase the understanding of the complexity of the transition. Surveys and observations were used to collect data about the learning experiences of playing the game GO2Zero. The results show that participants liked to play the game and they considered the game a valid representation of the system. Further, the participants agree that they obtained a better understanding of the complexity of the residential energy system and experienced a variety of challenges in the transition. Simulation games, like GO2Zero, could become valuable instruments in local energy transition processes as they offer a safe environment for novices and experts to jointly experiment with the challenges in this process. These experiences could support the design of the transition process by helping actors to formulate goals and collaborative strategies for achieving those goals. Future research will focus on the use of this game for experimenting with different strategies and instruments and to analyze their effects. © 2018 by the authors.",Energy renovation; Energy transition; Low carbon cities; Simulation games; Stakeholder management,alternative energy; energy resource; fossil fuel; residential energy; simulation; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban area,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050401782

We introduce a value-based approach, which entails that different characteristics of energy projects may violate or support people's core values, which evokes emotions in people. We present a theoretical framework of the relationship between people's values, the (perceived) implications of energy projects for these values, and people's emotional responses to energy projects.

The purpose of this paper is to understand in more detail how EO influences firm performance. It adds to the literature by distinguishing performances of different functions in a firm and by exploring how the dimensions of EO influence these functional performances and, in turn, overall firm performance. Design/methodology/approach: This study examined the relationship between three dimensions of EO (innovativeness, proactiveness, risk-taking), three types of functional performances of firms (R&D performance, production performance, marketing and sales performance) and the overall performance of firms. The data are collected from 279 high-tech small-to-medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) using a postal survey. The proposed hypotheses are tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). Findings: The results indicate that the dimensions of (EO) are related in different ways to the performance of functions in a firm. A positive relationship is observed between innovativeness and R&D performance and between proactiveness and marketing and sales performance. A negative relationship exists between risk-taking and production performance. The results also show a sequential positive relationship from R&D via production and marketing and sales to overall performance of firms. Therefore, it is concluded that the R&D, production and marketing and sales functions reinforce each other in a logic order and are complementary in their effect on overall firm performance. Practical implications: The results imply that the three functions, R&D, production and marketing and sales, in a firm play different roles, both in the firm’s EO and in their contribution to overall performance. Managers can use the findings to monitor and influence the performance of different functions in a firm to increase overall firm performance. Originality/value: The first contribution of this study is that it unravels (i) which dimensions of EO have an effect on the performance of separate functions in a firm, indicating that functions contribute in different ways to entrepreneurial orientation of the firm. A second contribution is assessing how the performance of these functions influence the firm’s overall performance. This paper fills a gap in the literature by exploring internal firm variables mediating the relationship between EO and overall firm performance and contributes to the discussion on the contradictory results regarding the relationship between risk-taking and firm performance. © 2018, Jafar Rezaei and Roland Ortt.",entrepreneurial orientation; Entrepreneurship and small business management; Marketing performance; Overall performance; Production performance; R&D performance; SEM; SMEs,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046403532

Despite their potency in view of consumer-owned distributed generation and enhanced citizen influence in the organization of the energy infrastructure, local low-carbon energy initiatives (LLCEIs) struggle to become viable alternatives to the centralized, private oriented energy system. To further LLCEI development, support needs to build their capacities; alleviate institutional hurdles and barriers stemming from the fossil fuel-based energy regime; and open up the system for the uptake, acceptance or breakthrough of LLCEIs. Evidence suggests that so-called ""intermediaries"" form a part of the solution in addressing these issues. Despite previous attempts at analyzing intermediary roles and activities vis-à-vis the development of community energy, the reality of the various roles and strategies intermediaries can employ and the support LLCEIs require to further develop have not yet been synthesized in a comprehensive analytical framework. This article aims to fill this gap by developing such a framework. We reflect on the analytical framework by evaluating the intermediary support structure in a specific case: the Province of Fryslân. From the analysis, we conclude that the Frisian case provided modest support to the claim that intermediary support is effective in addressing the needs of LLCEIs as the strategies and roles observed represent a complete and coherent support structure. © 2018 by the authors.",Asset-based community development; Business incubator; Community energy; Endogenous development; Grassroots innovations; Intermediary; Strategic niche management,analytical framework; civil society; climate change; fossil fuel; governance approach; grassroots level; strategic approach; Friesland; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049933614

However, trajectory data are difficult to observe over large spatiotemporal regions—particularly in urban contexts—due to practical, technical and financial constraints. The next best thing is to estimate plausible trajectories from whatever data are available. This paper presents a generic data assimilation framework to reconstruct such plausible trajectories on signalized urban arterials using microscopic traffic flow models and data from loops (individual vehicle passages and thus vehicle counts); traffic control data; and (sparse) travel time measurements from whatever source available. The key problem we address is that loops suffer from miss- and over-counts, which result in unbounded errors in vehicle accumulations, rendering trajectory reconstruction highly problematic. Our framework solves this problem in two ways. First, we correct the systematic error in vehicle accumulation by fusing the counts with sparsely available travel times. Second, the proposed framework uses particle filtering and an innovative hierarchical resampling scheme, which effectively integrates over the remaining error distribution, resulting in plausible trajectories. The proposed data assimilation framework is tested and validated using simulated data. Experiments and an extensive sensitivity analysis show that the proposed method is robust to errors both in the model and in the measurements, and provides good estimations for vehicle accumulation and vehicle trajectories with moderate sensor quality. The framework does not impose restrictions on the type of microscopic models used and can be naturally extended to include and estimate additional trajectory attributes such as destination and path, given data are available for assimilation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Data assimilation; Microscopic traffic simulation; Noisy sensor data; Particle filters; Vehicle accumulation estimation; Vehicle trajectory reconstruction,Errors; Monte Carlo methods; Quality control; Sensitivity analysis; Signal reconstruction; Trajectories; Travel time; Vehicles; Data assimilation; Microscopic traffic simulation; Noisy sensors; Particle filter; Vehicle trajectories; Street traffic control; data assimilation; model; Monte Carlo analysis; reconstruction; sensor; traffic management; trajectory; urban transport,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047316067

The evolution of domino accidents triggered by fire is different from domino accidents triggered by other primary scenarios, since the escalation caused by heat radiation is delayed with respect to the start of the fire. In this study, a methodology involving a Domino Evolution Graph (DEG) model and a Minimum Evolution Time (MET) algorithm is proposed to model the spatial-temporal evolution of domino accidents. Synergistic effects and parallel effects of the spatial evolution, as well as superimposed effects of the temporal evolution possibly occurring in complex domino evolution processes, are considered in this study. A case study demonstrates that the methodology is able to not only capture the spatial-temporal dimension but also to overcome the limitation of the “probit model” w.r.t only able to estimate the damage probability of the first level propagation. Besides, different from simulation or Bayesian approaches, our methodology can quickly provide evolution graphs (paths), the evolution time and the corresponding probability given a primary scenario. Therefore our approach can also be applied to domino risk assessment within an industrial park level and provide support for the allocation decision of safety and security resources. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Domino effects; Domino evolution graph; Heat radiation; Minimum evolution time; Spatial-temporal evolution,Accident prevention; Accidents; Bayesian networks; Fires; Graph algorithms; Heat radiation; Risk assessment; Allocation decision; Bayesian approaches; Domino effects; Domino evolution graph; Innovative methodologies; Minimum evolution; Safety and securities; Spatial-temporal evolution; Radiation effects,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046840218

MORDM has four phases: a systems analytical problem formulation, a search phase to generate candidate solutions, a trade-off analysis where different strategies are compared across many objectives, and a scenario discovery phase to identify the vulnerabilities. In its original inception, the search phase identifies optimal strategies for a single reference scenario for deep uncertainties, which may result in missing locally near-optimal, but globally more robust strategies. Recent work has addressed this issue by generating candidate strategies for multiple policy-relevant scenarios. In this paper, we incorporate a systematic scenario selection procedure in the search phase to consider both policy relevance and scenario diversity. The results demonstrate an increased tradeoff variety besides higher robustness, compared to the solutions found for a reference scenario. Future research can routinize multi-scenario search in MORDM with the aid of software packages. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Multi-objective optimization; Robust decision making; Scenario diversity; Scenario selection,Economic and social effects; Multiobjective optimization; Analytical problems; Deep uncertainties; Model based approach; Robust decisions; Scenario diversity; Scenario selection; Selection procedures; Trade-off analysis; Decision making; decision making; environmental modeling; multiobjective programming; numerical model; optimization; policy making; scenario analysis; software; trade-off,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045697683

The threat of climate change, fossil fuel depletion and the growing world energy demand ask for a more sustainable way of electricity production, eg, by using renewable energy sources, by improving the conversion efficiency and/or by controlling power plant emissions. Despite the relationship between exergy and sustainability stated in literature, exergy losses are usually not considered when comparing systems and energy sources for power generation. The exergetic sustainability assessment method named Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) has been used to assess several systems for electricity production, ie, a coal-fired power plant, a coal-fired power plant including carbon capture and storage, a biomass-fired power plant, an offshore wind farm and a photovoltaic park. The results of the TCExL method have been compared with an environmental sustainability indicator, ie, the overall ReCiPe endpoint indicator and the economic indicator named Present Worth Ratio. The offshore wind farm is the best system from the exergetic and environmental point of view. The photovoltaic park is the system with the second-best scores. However, from the economic viewpoint including subsidy by the Dutch government, the photovoltaic park performs better than the wind farm system and the system that performs best is the biomass-fired power plant. Without subsidy, only the coal-fired power plant without carbon capture and storage is profitable. The exergetic sustainability scores of the coal-fired and biomass-fired power plants are similar, but from the environmental sustainability viewpoint, the biomass-fired power plant performs better than both coal-fired power plants. As the results of environmental and economic sustainability assessments strongly depend on models, weighting factors, subsidy, market prices, etc, while the results of the exergetic sustainability assessment do not, it is recommended that the exergetic sustainability be taken into account when assessing the sustainability of power generation and other technological systems. © 2018 The Authors.

The floodwalls along the Huangpu River provide protection against typhoon-induced flooding. However, there is limited insight into the actual safety level of the flood defences in Shanghai, and recent failures have highlighted their vulnerability. Therefore, the aims of this paper are to derive a series of new flood frequency curves for the Huangpu River, and to evaluate the level of protection of the floodwall system. This paper analysed over 100 years (1912-2013) of annual maximum water levels for three stations at near-sea, mid-stream and inland locations along the Huangpu River. Best-fit curves were determined for a number of selected probability distributions using statistical performance indicators. As a result, new flood frequency curves of the water levels for different storm surge return periods were produced. The results showed that generalised extreme value (GEV) was identified as the most suitable probability distribution for the datasets. Analysis showed that the current design water levels correspond to exceedance probabilities of 1/500 per year at the near-sea and mid-stream stations, and no more than 1/50 per year at the inland station of the Huangpu River, whereas the intended safety standard is 1/1000 per year. A comparison of the findings with a dataset of the crest heights of the floodwalls showed that the current protection level of the floodwalls along the Huangpu River is expected to be around 1/50 per year in terms of overtopping for the lowest sections. The results of this study can be utilized to provide future recommendations for flood risk management in Shanghai. © 2018 by the authors.",Flood risk; Frequency analysis; Huangpu River; Protection level; Storm surge,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048930632

Recently, making more room for the river is, however, being challenged for future application because the flood defenses are assessed to be too weak and will need reinforcement anyway. To be able to decide on the most desirable policy for the remainder of the century, we require knowledge of all benefits and costs of individual interventions and strategic alternatives for flood mitigation. In this paper, we quantify some benefits of making more room for the rivers. We recognize and quantify two risk-reducing effects and provide results of analyses for the Rhine and Meuse Rivers in The Netherlands. Making room for rivers was originally advocated because it (1) reduces the consequences of flooding, as well as (2) reduces the probability of failure of the embankments. We have now quantified these effects allowing translation into risk reduction proper. Moreover, larger floodplain surface area may influence the relationship between discharge and flood level, which implies that rivers with widened floodplains are less sensitive to uncertainties about future river discharges. This does not reduce risk proper, but makes the river system more robust, as we shall argue in the discussion where we present risk reduction and robustness as complementary perspectives for assessing strategic alternatives for flood risk management. © 2018 by the authors.

It unlocked the climate change gridlock, introducing country-subjective commitments and a five-year review mechanism. To support the implementation of the Paris Agreement, we designed the Nzoia WeShareIt climate change game. Game sessions were conducted in June and July 2015, and 35 respondents completed a pre- and post-game situation awareness (SA) questionnaire and an in-game performance measurement system. The questionnaire uses a 10-dimensional situation awareness rating technique (SART). Subsequently, we conducted a factorial MANOVA (multivariate analysis of variance) to assess the interaction effects between familiarity, team, and gender. Results indicate an increase in situation awareness. However, policymakers' action was not contingent on the increased SA only, there was a significant interaction effect between familiarity and SA, to lead to climate change actions. Therefore, we recommend more emphasis on the role of familiarity in enhancing SA and, subsequently, supporting the implementation to the Paris five-year review country commitments. We also recommend the increased usage of symbols and capacity development of policymakers on connective capacity to enable them to span the climate change boundaries. © 2018 by the authors.",Climate change disaster risk reduction; Familiarity; Gender; Metaphors; Policy games; Situation awareness; Stories; Symbols; Synecdoche; Team cooperation; Water governance,action plan; climate change; disaster management; familiarity; gender; global climate; governance approach; policy development; policy implementation; policy making; questionnaire survey,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85048343945

The process pattern model is defined as a proven series of activities, aimed at improving the data quality given a certain context, a particular objective, and a specific set of initial conditions. Four different patterns are derived to deal with the variations in data quality of datasets.

Although several studies have investigated airline service quality, little attention has been paid to this crucial part of the system. This study proposes the SERVQUAL model to assess the perceived quality of service for the baggage handling system. A literature review provides a list of criteria per dimension of the SERVQUAL model. The best worst method (BWM) is used to calculate the weights of the criteria. The data for the BWM are collected via a sample of passengers from different nationalities. It is found that ‘reliability’ is perceived as the most important dimension followed by ‘responsiveness’. The ‘assurance’ criterion is third closely followed by ‘tangibles’ and lastly ‘empathy’. A cluster analysis further sheds light on how passengers might have different service quality priorities. © 2017 The Authors",Baggage handling; Best worst method; BWM; Quality; SERVQUAL,air transportation; cargo handling; transportation system,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035358442

Digital platforms are a challenging research object because of their distributed nature and intertwinement with institutions, markets and technologies. New research challenges arise as a result of the exponentially growing scale of platform innovation, the increasing complexity of platform architectures and the spread of digital platforms to many different industries. This paper develops a research agenda for digital platforms research in IS. We recommend researchers seek to (1) advance conceptual clarity by providing clear definitions that specify the unit of analysis, degree of digitality and the sociotechnical nature of digital platforms; (2) define the proper scoping of digital platform concepts by studying platforms on different architectural levels and in different industry settings; and (3) advance methodological rigour by employing embedded case studies, longitudinal studies, design research, data-driven modelling and visualisation techniques. Considering current developments in the business domain, we suggest six questions for further research: (1) Are platforms here to stay? (2) How should platforms be designed? (3) How do digital platforms transform industries? (4) How can data-driven approaches inform digital platforms research? (5) How should researchers develop theory for digital platforms? and (6) How do digital platforms affect everyday life? © 2017 Association for Information Technology Trust.",digital ecosystems; digital infrastructures; digital innovation; digital platforms; research agenda,Digital ecosystem; Digital infrastructures; Digital innovations; Digital platforms; Research agenda,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018241471

For this governments have embraced smart parking initiatives, which should result in a high utilization of public space and minimization of the driving, in this way reducing the emissions of cars. Yet, simply opening data about the availability of public spaces results in more congestions as multiple cars might be heading for the same parking space. In this work, we propose a Multiple Criteria based Parking space Reservation (MCPR) algorithm, for reserving a space for a user to deal with parking space in a fair way. Users' requirements are the main driving factor for the algorithm and used as criteria in MCPR. To evaluate the algorithm, simulations for three set of user preferences were made. The simulation results show that the algorithm satisfied the users' request fairly for all the three preferences. The algorithm helps users automatically to find a parking space according to the users' requirements. The algorithm can be used in a smart parking system to search for a parking space on behalf of user and send parking space information to the user. © 2018 is held by the owner/author(s).",Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Reservation algorithm; Smart city; Smart parking,Decision theory; Operations research; Search engines; Smart city; Driving factors; High utilizations; Multiple criteria; Multiple criteria decision analysis; Parking reservations; Reservation algorithms; Smart parking; Smart parking systems; Parking,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85049047628

However, its practical application in the Nile Basin has been a significant challenge, leading to a water allocation deadlock. To address the deadlock, we used the van Eeten (1999) four-step process for defining new agendas. To reconstruct the debate, nine possible water allocation methods are developed using the Stone (2002) framework. After that, the arguments are compared and contrasted using interpretative policy analysis and the relevant factors to determine equitable and reasonable utilization in the Nile basin. Unfortunately, none of the nine possible water allocation methods satisfied all of the factors of assessing equitable and reasonable utilization. Therefore, we identified a crosswalk position that combines three water allocation methods. This combination consists of: (1) a group-based distribution; (2) a value-based distribution; and (3) a consensus-based distribution. Since the crosswalk position does not address current and potential uses, we recommend a new agenda to recast the issue. This agenda entails a change in the recipient of the water resources, the allocated item, and the process of decision-making. Finally, we discuss the potential of applying the proposed methodology in Nile sub-basins and other river basins within Sub-Saharan Africa. © 2018 by the authors.",Deadlock; Discourse analysis; Distributive policy; Equality; Equitable and reasonable utilization; Fairness; Interpretative policy analysis; Nile river basin; Water allocation; Water law,Crosswalks; Decision making; Watersheds; Deadlock; Discourse analysis; Equality; Fairness; Nile rivers; Policy analysis; Water allocations; Water laws; Water resources; decision making; policy analysis; reconstruction; resource allocation; water resource; Nile Basin; Sub-Saharan Africa,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047783204

Our study assesses whether and how rural residents' engage in environmental activism (EA) against mining. This is achieved by constructing a model of EA strategies, coupled to variables that examine respondents' intentions. The model uses data from a survey (n = 352) covering 37 villages spread over 5 provinces and 1 provincial-level municipality. The model is based on a refinement of the theory of planned behavior (TPB). Various findings are reported: (1) a majority of respondents (77%) believes that pollution in the mining areas is serious; (2) there is pessimism about the effects of EA with 41% believing it does not improve the environment, and less than one-fifth feeling the government supports EA, contradictorily; (3) well over half has engaged in one or more forms of EA, while (4) dominant EA strategies consist of complaining to local government or village authorities (both over 40%), or open protest (opted for by over 17%); (5) economic dependency and gender affect the intention for EA, as those employed in mining and women are less inclined to participate. Whereas studies pointed to ""inclined abstainers"" or the ""silent majority"", this study ascertains that-with regard to mining-rural residents are not silent. We posit that a threshold of environmental endurance might have been reached. In this context, policymakers need to tackle the adverse effects of mining, as it is likely to generate more violent confrontations that ultimately pose risks to political credibility and social stability. © 2018 by the authors.",Environmentalism; Farmers' resistance; Mining; Social conflict and protest,gender; local government; mining; perception; policy making; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; rural area; rural population; strategic approach; village; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047247238

In this paper, we study the cooperative economic scheduling problem for multiple neighboring integrated energy systems on the basis of EH. Different with the traditional non-cooperative mode where each EH operates individually, these EHs constitute a cooperative community and can share energy among them. Considering the autonomy and self-interest of different EHs, the coordinated management problem is modeled as a bargaining cooperative game, where involved EHs will bargain with each other about the exchanged energy and the associated payments. The bargaining solution can achieve a fair and Pareto-optimal balance among the objective functions of different EHs. A distributed optimization is applied to find the bargaining solution of the cooperative system, to guarantee the autonomous scheduling and information privacy of EHs. Numerical studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the bargaining-based cooperative economic scheduling framework, and also show the improvement of benefits of the community system. © 2013 IEEE.",Cooperative game; distributed approach; energy hub; energy trading; multiple energy system; Nash bargaining,Energy management; Game theory; Pareto principle; Cooperative game; Distributed approaches; Energy hubs; Energy systems; Energy trading; Nash bargaining; Scheduling,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85047215032

Here, we take an agent-based approach to model investor decision making in the electricity sector by modelling investors as actors with different (heterogeneous) anticipations of the future. With only a limited set of assumptions, this generic model replicates the dynamics of the liberalised electricity market of the last decades and points out dynamics that are to be expected as the energy transition progresses. Importantly, these dynamics are emergent properties of the evolving electricity system resulting from actor (investor) behaviour. We have experimented with varying carbon price scenarios and find that incorporating heterogeneous investor behaviour results in a large bandwidth of possible transition pathways, and that the depth of renewables penetration is correlated with the variability of their power generation pattern. Furthermore, a counter-intuitive trend was observed, namely that average profits of investors are seen to increase with carbon prices. These results are a vivid and generic illustration that outcome-based policy cannot be solely based on market instruments that rely on perfect rational and perfectly informed agents. © 2018 The Authors",Agent-based modelling; Decarbonisation; Electricity; Electricity markets; Investor behaviour; Scenarios,Autonomous agents; Carbon; Commerce; Computational methods; Decision making; Dynamics; Electric industry; Electricity; Power markets; Agent-based approach; Agent-based modelling; Decarbonisation; Heterogeneous investors; Investor behaviour; Liberalised electricity market; Renewable technology; Scenarios; Investments; decision making; electricity; electricity industry; energy market; energy policy; investment; power generation; scenario analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046034641

There are several MCDM methods, the two core elements of which are (i) evaluating the performance of the alternatives with respect to the criteria, (ii) finding the importance (weight) of the criteria. There are several methods to find the weights of the criteria, however, when it comes to the alternative measures with respect to the criteria, usually the existing MCDM methods use simple monotonic linear value functions. Usually an increasing or decreasing linear function is assumed between a criterion level (over its entire range) and its value. This assumption, however, might lead to improper results. This study proposes a family of piecewise value functions which can be used for different decision criteria for different decision problems. Several real-world examples from existing literature are provided to illustrate the applicability of the proposed value functions. A numerical example of supplier selection (including a comparison between simple monotonic linear value functions, piecewise linear value functions, and exponential value functions) shows how considering proper value functions could affect the final results of an MCDM problem. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Decision criteria; MCDM; Monotonicity; Multi-criteria decision-making; Value function,Piecewise linear techniques; Decision criterions; MCDM; Monotonicity; Multi criteria decision making; Value functions; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040356175

A recent conceptual model of cyberspace is used, which distinguishes between a technical, socio-technical, and governance layer. The issue of cyber warfare governance is addressed through a literature review, interviews, and a partial SWOT analysis. The literature review provides first insight into existing definitions and perceptions of cyber warfare in the international and Dutch context. Second, the main stakeholders regarding cyber warfare in the Netherlands and their governance roles are identified. The interviews provide more detail and enable partial cross-check of the published narrative. A SWOT analysis allows identification of the main challenges (weaknesses) connected to the governance of cyber warfare in the Netherlands and corresponding mitigating factors (opportunities). The research findings show the infancy stage of cyber warfare capabilities and governance in the Netherlands. They testify to the problem of reconciling differing and sometimes conflicting interests, and point to the need for collaboration and unified coordination of governance efforts within the Netherlands. However, governance of national cyber warfare capabilities requires more than a concerted national effort alone.

Based on such practical tools, it is possible to measure where an organisation is situated regarding its safety culture in order to identify priority areas, formulate appropriate improvement strategies and determine changes over time. In this paper, it is examined which practical tools to measure and improve safety culture are provided on the Belgian market. In total, 15 Belgian tools were identified, of which 8 agreed to cooperate. Amongst the included tools, there is a lot of variation regarding the methods to diagnose the safety culture and the overall procedure to improve the safety culture. The importance to adapt the tool to the specific needs and context of organisations is acknowledged in most of the tools, as well as the importance to use a multi-method approach to measure the safety culture. Also, it is recognised that all hierarchic levels should participate during the process of diagnosing the safety culture. A point of attention is this overall participation during the validation of the results of the diagnosis, and the priority setting of the recommendations, which is mainly done by the higher management. The development of the Belgian tools is based on experience with a focus on direct practical application, which leads to the fact that none of the tools are validated through scientific evidence. Another point of attention is that organisations pay too little attention at the continuity of safety culture research. And finally, the question can be raised if the safety culture tools actually address the concept ‘safety culture’, or if they address only a subset of the concept. When safety culture is addressed, a comprehensive approach should be used, where technological, organisational, human and external aspects are taken into account as interacting and interrelating elements. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Belgium; improving; measuring; organisations; safety culture,Engineering; Safety engineering; Belgium; improving; measuring; organisations; Safety culture; Societies and institutions,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992096742

This offshore grid is a multi-level, multi-actor system requiring a governance decision-making approach, but there is currently no proven governance framework for it, or for the expansion planning of the European power system in general. In addition, existing offshore expansion planning models do not endogenously include governance considerations, such as country vetoes to integrated lines. We develop a myopic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model of offshore generation and transmission expansion planning to study the effect of integrated governance constraints. These constraints limit investments in integrated lines: non-conventional lines linking offshore wind farms to other countries or to other farms. Each constraint affects the system (including the main transmission corridors), transmission technologies and welfare distribution differently. We apply our model to a long-term case study of the 2030–2050 offshore expansion pathways using data from the e-Highway2050 project. Results confirm that the offshore grid is beneficial to society. Integrated governance constraints induce a modest loss of social welfare, but do not change significantly the existing welfare distribution asymmetry between countries and actor groups. They do strongly affect the interaction of line technologies and types (conventional or integrated), so the impact of the integrated governance constraints is more visible on the grid topology than on welfare levels and distribution. We highlight the need to consider technology and type interactions in expansion planning, especially between multiterminal HVDC and integrated transmission lines. Also, an offshore governance framework should address the use of multiterminal HVDC in a non-integrated grid, but this is a second-best option compared to an integrated grid. © 2018 The Authors",Expansion planning; Governance; North Sea; Offshore grid; Offshore wind; Simulation,Decision making; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Expansion; HVDC power transmission; Integer programming; Expansion planning; Governance; North Sea; Offshore grid; Offshore winds; Simulation; Offshore wind farms; alternative energy; energy market; energy planning; expansion; governance approach; linear programing; offshore structure; power generation; simulation; wind farm; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046627507

One country with a strong drive to engage in urban (re)development in the post-oil era through enhancing its 'ecological modernization' is Iran. Megacities in Iran have all begun to venture into making profiles of what they think they are or would like to be. However, some of the adopted city branding strategies lack sophistication. In this article, the authors examine what indicators can be used for evaluating the credibility of city brands and apply these to Iran's 15 megacities. After offering brief descriptions of the generic features of each of these cities, they map their use of city brand identities and popular city labels related to ecological modernization and analyze the credibility of their city branding practices. Based on their findings, the authors distinguish five types of cities and explain what makes some types more credible in their use of brands than others. Generally speaking, compared to cities in other nations, Iranian cities pay special attention to historical, natural, cultural, and religious aspects. © 2018 by the authors.",Brand credibility; City branding; Ecological modernization; Iran; Megacities,ecological approach; marketing; megacity; modernization; redevelopment; urban development; Iran,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046071673

The accident was triggered by a natural hazard: freezing of piping at a control station caused an inlet pipe elbow to crack, which in turn, led to the release of high-pressure liquid propane which was rapidly ignited. In addition, there were two near-miss events due to potential domino effects. In fact, the accident could reasonably have resulted in much more severe consequences due to the exposure of large butane storage spheres and chlorine containers, increasing the possibility of a catastrophic domino effect. This paper develops a Natech (natural hazard triggering technological disasters) risk assessment methodology that relies upon Bayesian network capabilities and takes into account the potential Natech domino effects. The methodology is implemented in the intended refinery and mathematically graphically represents the dynamic cause–effect relations between units involved in the scenario, and handles uncertainties among the interactions. In addition, the methodology can provide a risk value for the entire scenario that can be used further for risk-based decision making. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Bayesian network; Domino effect; Natech accident; Risk assessment,Accidents; Bayesian networks; Behavioral research; Hazards; Propane; Refining; Risk perception; Control station; Domino effects; High-pressure liquid; Natural hazard; Network capability; Risk assessment methodologies; Risk based decision making; Technological disasters; Risk assessment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85045947893

However, these timetables only maximize the probability of a passenger to take the train, but provide no insight on the actual choices of the passengers. Therefore, in this manuscript we replace the deterministic passenger satisfaction function with a probabilistic demand forecasting model inside of the passenger centric train timetable design. The actual forecasts lead to a realistic train occupation. Knowing the train occupation, we can estimate the revenue and to use pricing as a mobility management to further improve the level-of-service. We use a logit model that we calibrate to reflect the known demand elasticities. We further include a competing operator as an opt-out option for the passengers. Subsequently, we integrate the passenger centric train timetabling problem with a ticket pricing problem. We solve the elastic passenger centric train timetabling problem for various types of timetables using a simulated annealing heuristic on a case study of Israeli Railways. The results of our case study show that the generated revenues can be increased by up to 15% when taking into account the passengers’ behavior along with a specific pricing scheme.

Probability analysis of accidents resulting from domino effects is important for risk assessment. However, for the accident occurrence of a unit there may be mutual influences between the units in the area influenced by the accidents due to a domino effect, and this makes the calculation of probabilities of the accidents rather difficult. A matrix-based approach is proposed to model the influences between units influenced by a fire-induced domino effects, and the analysis approach for accident propagation as well as a simulation-based algorithm for probability calculation of accidents is provided. The synergistic effect of thermal radiation is taken into account during the accident propagation. The proposed approach is flexible to model and analyze domino effects in various conditions of primary fires by only changing the value of the initial matrix indicating the fire states. Two examples illustrate analyzing the fire propagation among tanks storing flammable liquids. The results show that this approach is simple but effective for offering an insight in the accident propagation process and for knowing the probabilities of equipment getting on fire. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Domino effect; Matrix modeling; Probability analysis; Process industry,Fires; Risk assessment; Accident propagation; Domino effects; Matrix based approach; Matrix model; Probability analysis; Probability calculations; Process industries; Simulation-based algorithms; Accidents,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85043355924

Unfortunately, increasing copper extraction and decreasing ore grades intensify energy use and generate higher environmental impact. A potential solution would be reaching a circular economy of copper, in which secondary production provides a large part of the demand. A necessary first step in this direction is to understand future copper demand. In this study, we estimated the copper demand until 2100 under different scenarios with regression and stock dynamics methods. For the stock dynamics method, a strong growth of copper demand is found in the scenarios with a high share of renewable energy, in which a much higher copper intensity for the electricity system and the transport sector is seen. The regression predicts a wider range of copper demand depending on the scenario. The regression method requires less data but lacks the ability to incorporate the expected decoupling of material use and GDP when the stock saturates, limiting its applicability for long-term estimations.

We have combined the data from a public attitude survey (N = 705) with a content analysis of 280 news articles on the pricing proposal published in five leading Dutch newspapers. Our findings show that news exposure and attitudes/beliefs about road pricing policies are associated not only at the aggregate level, as shown by past research, but also at the individual level. The direction of attitudes/beliefs and tone of news change in the same direction (e.g., the higher the amount of negative news exposed, the more negative the attitudes towards Kilometerheffing). Our findings also show that the significance and direction of association (in parallel with or opposite to the tone of news—negative or positive) changes according to the issue featured in the news and the strength of the individual’s values. News exposure is not associated with beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on one’s own financial situation but rather with beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on the environment and congestion. Furthermore, the strength of the biospheric value (which concerns the quality of nature and environment) negatively moderates the relationship between news exposure and beliefs about the impact of Kilometerheffing on environment-congestion. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Attitudes; Beliefs; Media; News; Road pricing; Values,Costs; Roads and streets; Transportation; Transportation charges; Attitudes; Beliefs; Media; News; Road pricing; Values; Traffic control; mass media; price dynamics; public attitude; road transport; survey; transportation policy; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85001820042

First we extend our analytic framework that characterizes data attacks as optimization problems with the objectives specified as security metrics and constraints corresponding to the communication network properties. Second, we build a platform in the form of co-simulation-coupling the power system simulator DIgSILENT PowerFactory with communication network simulator OMNeT++, and Matlab for EMS applications (state estimation, optimal power flow). Then the framework is used to conduct attack simulations on the co-simulation based platform for a power grid test case.

ATES is important for the energy transition in many urban areas in North America, Europe and Asia. Despite the modest current ATES adoption level of about 0.2% of all buildings in the Netherlands, ATES subsurface space use has already grown to congestion levels in many Dutch urban areas. This problem is to a large extent caused by the current planning and permitting approach, which uses too spacious safety margins between wells and a 2D rather than 3D perspective. The current methods for permitting and planning of ATES do not lead to optimal use of available subsurface space, and, therefore, prevent realization of the expected contribution of the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by ATES. Optimal use of subsurface space in dense urban settings can be achieved with a coordinated approach towards the planning and operation of ATES systems, so-called ATES planning. This research identifies and elaborates crucial practical steps to achieve optimal use of subsurface space that are currently missing in the planning method. Analysis from existing ATES plans and exploratory modeling, coupling agent-based and groundwater models were used to demonstrate that minimizing GHG emissions requires progressively stricter regulation with intensifying demand for ATES. The simulations also quantified both the thresholds beyond which such stricter rules are needed as well as the effectiveness of different planning strategies, which can now effectively be used for ATES planning in practice. The results provide scientific insight in how technical choices in ATES well design, location and operation affect optimal use of subsurface space, and what trade-offs exist between the energy efficiency of individual systems and the combined reduction of the GHG emissions from a plan area. The presented ATES planning method following from the obtained insights now fosters practical planning and design rules suitable to ensure optimal and sustainable use of subsurface space – that is, maximizing GHG emission reductions by accommodating as many ATES systems as possible in the available aquifer, while maintaining a high efficiency for the individual ATES systems. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Aquifer Thermal Energy Storage (ATES); ATES planning; Optimal use of subsurface space,Aquifers; Cooling systems; Coupling agents; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater resources; Heat storage; Structural design; Thermal energy; Thermography (temperature measurement); Aquifer thermal energy storage; Energy transitions; Fossil energy consumption; Groundwater models; Heating and cooling; Optimal use of subsurface space; Planning and design; Planning strategies; Urban planning; aquifer; building; cooling; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; heating; numerical method; planning method; strategic approach; urban area; Asia; Europe; Netherlands; North America,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042390287

As a major obstacle, current inferences from abuse data that aim to characterize providers with poor security practices often use a naive normalization of abuse (abuse counts divided by network size) and do not take into account other inherent or structural properties of providers. Even the size estimates are subject to measurement errors relating to attribution, aggregation, and various sources of heterogeneity. More precise indicators are costly to measure at Internet scale. We address these issues for the case of hosting providers with a statistical model of the abuse data generation process, using phishing sites in hosting networks as a case study. We decompose error sources and then estimate key parameters of the model, controlling for heterogeneity in size and business model. We find that 84% of the variation in abuse counts across 45,358 hosting providers can be explained with structural factors alone. Informed by the fitted model, we systematically select and enrich a subset of 105 homogeneous “statistical twins” with additional explanatory variables, unreasonable to collect for all hosting providers. We find that abuse is positively associated with the popularity of websites hosted and with the prevalence of popular content management systems. Moreover, hosting providers who charge higher prices (after controlling for level differences between countries) witness less abuse. These structural factors together explain a further 77% of the remaining variation. This calls into question premature inferences from raw abuse indicators about the security efforts of actors, and suggests the adoption of similar analysis frameworks in all domains where network measurement aims at informing technology policy. © 2018 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

Humans have an increasing impact on ecosystems worldwide, while at the same time ecosystems are of critical importance for the functioning of human systems through ecosystems services. Often the term “social ecological systems” is used in approaches that consider ecological and social systems as integrated systems. This paper aims to contribute to clarification of the different relationships between social and ecological systems. The focus is on the social side of ecological restoration and conservation, in particular on participation, indigenous knowledge, governance, and ethics. It is concluded that in restoration and conservation of social ecological systems more attention should be paid to the role of social systems and conditions on which ecosystems depend.

New technologies often give rise to societal controversies about their potential risks and benefits. Over the last decades, social scientists, psychologists, and philosophers have criticized quantitative approaches to risk on the grounds that they oversimplify its societal and ethical implications. There is broad consensus amongst these scholars that stakeholders and their values and concerns should be included in decision-making about technological risks. It has also been argued that the emotional responses of people can shed important light on the ethical aspects of risk and uncertainty. However, people’s emotions can be narrowly focused and biased. This article therefore assesses the role that technology-inspired artworks can play in overcoming such biases, by challenging our imagination and providing us with different perspectives on possible technological developments and their implications for society. Philosophers have not yet studied such artworks, so this constitutes an entirely new field of research for scholars of risk and moral theory. In particular, we focus on the case of BNCI (Brain/Neural Computer Interface) technologies and related artworks. These technologies and artworks touch on questions of what it means to be human, thereby raising profound ethical and philosophical challenges. We discuss the experiences of artists, scientists, and engineers who are directly involved with BNCI technologies, and who were interviewed during a Hackathon at Amsterdam’s Waag Society in June 2016. Their views are analyzed in light of philosophical and aesthetic theories, which allows us to consider relevant ethical and conceptual issues as well as topics for further investigation. © 2018, The Author(s).",Aesthetics; Art; Brain/neural computer interfaces; Controversial technologies; Emotions; Ethics; Risk,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044574578

A conceptual framework for those impacts is developed based on the model of four accessibility components (i.e. land use, transport, temporal and individual) of Geurs and van Wee (2004). Q-method is applied among a sample of seventeen international accessibility experts to explore heterogeneity among experts with respect to the impacts of AVs on accessibility, and study different views and clusters of experts. Q-method statements are deductively categorized according to four accessibility components of the conceptual framework. Three viewpoints were extracted, indicating that experts expect AVs to influence accessibility through all four accessibility components. Viewpoint A expects that accessibility benefits stemming from AVs will be highly uncertain, mainly because of induced travel demand that will likely cancel out travel time and cost savings of AVs in the long term. Viewpoint B anticipates that accessibility changes because of AVs will have two opposing implications for urban form: densification of city center and further urban sprawl. Finally, viewpoint C expects that those who can afford an AV will mainly enjoy AVs benefits, thus AVs will have more negative than positive implications for social equity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Accessibility; Fully automated vehicles; Location choices; Q-method; Vehicle sharing; Viewpoints,accessibility; automation; conceptual framework; heterogeneity; transport vehicle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044260283

Together they form so-called mega-city regions referred to as the Greater Pearl River Delta, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Bohai Rim, each encompassing a dozen or so cities. In the wake of staggering economic growth and threatening pollution, these cities are compelled to respond to the challenge of ecological modernization (EM): aim for higher economic value added at lower environmental cost. Cities have particular industrial and regional profiles; consequently they follow different developmental pathways. In order to attract coveted investors, green and high-tech corporations, well-endowed residents and talented workforce, these cities engage in city branding practices. In this contribution, a typology of EM developmental pathways is presented and the 41 cities in the three Chinese mega-city regions are analyzed in terms of their respective pathways and city branding practices. We argue that different industrial and regional profiles allow for different developmental pathways making different city branding strategies likely. Most cities brand themselves in comformity with what their pathway would lead us to predict, except cities with a strongly manufacturing oriented profile; the brands of the latter type deviate markedly from their current reality. Cities adopting branding strategies that contrast sharply with their historical legacy and current profile risk promoting themselves in ways that the outside world is likely to perceive as lacking in credibility. © 2018","City brand identity; City labels; Developmental pathways; Ecological modernization; Mega-city regions,China",Ecology; Economic analysis; Modernization; River pollution; Brand identity; Branding strategies; Developmental pathways; Ecological modernizations; Economic value added; International economics; Mega city regions; Yangtze river delta; Economics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041486000

I first discuss three perspectives on the value of social conflict. Although invited participation is generally considered as a way to ameliorate, or anticipate social conflict on energy projects, this ‘participatory reflex’ goes past the fact that social conflict can itself be considered a form of participation, i.e. self-organized participation. Second, I discuss two basic characteristics of social conflict that show the limitations of invited participation in identifying and including divergent normative appraisals: 1) social conflict challenges institutions, and 2) social conflict involves emergent positions and groups. I propose to see social conflict as self-organized participation that serves as an source for identification and inclusion of normative appraisals in energy policy and planning. This not only necessitates the study of these phenomena as such, but also suggests a different approach to deal with such phenomena in research and practice. I will lay out three directions for further research. © 2018 The Author(s)",Constructive conflict; Energy transition; Governance; Social conflict,,Short Survey,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041395988

The paper starts by ascertaining why agricultural and food systems need to change systemically. Evidence from case studies in fourteen countries is used to explore the possibilities for, and drivers and limitations of systemic change in four thematic areas: the resilience of farms and rural areas; prosperity and well-being; knowledge and innovation, and; the governance of agriculture and rural areas. In each area, we identify a major mismatch between visions and strategies on the one hand, and market developments, policy measures and outcomes on the other. The first theme is of growing concern as there has been an observable decrease in the social-ecological resilience of farms and of rural communities in recent decades. The second theme emerges as important as the concentration of production in some regions or some farms is directly linked to the marginalisation of others. The third theme illustrates that local farmer-driven innovations can teach us much, especially since farmers focus on efficiently using the resources available to them, including their location-specific experiential knowledge. Through the final theme we show that informal networks can balance different interests and approaches, which is essential for integrated rural development strategies and projects. Our findings in these four thematic areas have implications for the strategic frameworks and policy of the EU (and beyond) and future research agendas. We explicitly draw these out. The 14 case studies show that practitioners, grassroots initiatives and pilot programmes are already generating a wealth of experiences and knowledge that could be fruitfully used to inform higher-level policy development. The paper concludes that systemic change requires more critical reflection of conventional wisdom and approaches, and openness to ideas and practices that are outside the mainstream. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Agriculture; Governance; Innovation; Policy; Resilience; Rural; Social-ecological systems; Sustainability; Transformation,European Union; farming system; food supply; grassroots level; marginalization; modernization; rural area; rural development; sustainability; sustainable development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021391785

This paper raises the alarm on the security implications of virtual switches. In particular,we showthat virtual switches not only increase the attack surface of the cloud, but virtual switch vulnerabilities can also lead to attacks of much higher impact compared to traditional switches. We present a systematic security analysis and identify four design decisions which introduce vulnerabilities. Our findings motivate us to revisit existing threat models for SDNbased cloud setups, and introduce a new attacker model for SDN-based cloud systems using virtual switches. We demonstrate the practical relevance of our analysis using a case study with Open vSwitch and OpenStack. Employing a fuzzing methodology, we find several exploitable vulnerabilities in Open vSwitch. Using just one vulnerability we were able to create a worm that can compromise hundreds of servers in a matter of minutes. Our findings are applicable beyond virtual switches: NFV and high-performance fast path implementations face similar issues.

However, the environmental issues in the central regions have become remarkably severe. It is therefore worthwhile exploring how economic development and environmental protection can be coordinated. Focusing on the 29 prefecture-level cities in the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration, the authors empirically analyze the relationship between the economy and the environment from 2004 to 2014. The combined methods of the spatial autocorrelation model, the environmental Kuznets curve, and the global spatial correlation test are systematically employed. The results show that: (1) a strong spatial correlation exists between industrial wastewater discharge, industrial sulfur dioxide, and dust emissions in the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration; (2) the relationship between the economy and the environment of this urban agglomeration reveals an inverted ""U"" curve, which confirms the classical environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis. Industrial dust emissions have surpassed the inflection point of the Kuznets curve, but its spatial spillover effect still remains strong. This is caused by an accumulation effect and a lag effect; (3) the proportion of the secondary industry and population has a strong positive effect on pollution discharge; investments in science and technology have a certain inhibitory effect on industrial sulfur dioxide emission. Moreover, an increase in the number of industrial enterprises has a negative effect on industrial wastewater emission. At the end, the authors put forward policy recommendations regarding the establishment of a joint supervisory department and unified environmental standards at the regional level to deal with the spillover effects of pollution. © 2018 by the authors.",Central PlainsUrbanAgglomeration; EnvironmentKuznets Curve; Spatial auto-correlationmodel,agglomeration; economic development; environmental economics; environmental issue; environmental protection; Kuznets curve; pollution; spatiotemporal analysis; spillover effect; strategic approach; urban area; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044612595

The authors specifically focus on three emerging technologies that have the potential to create more flexible conditions in the field, and identify the need to further explore the link between uncertainty, information and irreversibility. Design/methodology/approach: The authors present a basic structure for the analysis of cold chain disruptions in terms of three distinct yet connected layers of deficient infrastructure and capacity, information gaps and failures in decision making. The authors then review three humanitarian technologies and their impact on vaccine campaigns along these layers. From there, a research agenda is developed to address research gaps this review brought forward. Findings: Three critical research gaps in the areas of technology innovation for humanitarian vaccine cold chain management are presented. The authors argue that technology to improve capacity, information and decisions need to be aligned, and that the areas of uncertainty, information and irreversibility require further investigation to achieve this alignment. In this way, the paper contributes to setting the research agenda on vaccine cold chains and connects humanitarian logistics to technology, information management and decision making. Originality/value: This paper presents the humanitarian vaccine cold chain problem from an original angle by illuminating the implications of technology and information on the decisions made during the planning and implementation phases of a vaccine campaign.

However, demand response (DR) and electrical energy storage (EES) also contribute to system adequacy. In this paper, we analyse the change in the need for a CM if DR and EES are available, in the presence of a growing portfolio share of intermittent renewable energy sources electricity (RES-E). We present a novel hybrid electricity market model of the transition to a low-carbon electricity system which uses optimization for short-term market operations and agent-based simulation of long-term decisions. DR and EES may significantly reduce the risk of shortages in an energy-only market, even if investment decisions are myopic, like in our model, as compared to an energy-only market without flexibility options. We also present a novel mechanism for contribution of EES to the CM. This reduces the cost of the CM and improves the business case for EES. In our model, DR and EES achieve almost the same improvement of security of supply as a CM, but they do so at a lower cost. Therefore, the case for a centralized CM is weakened in a system with even a limited share of DR and medium-term EES, as presented in our model.

One of the main shortcomings of current indices is the limited set of aspects which are considered and are influencing inherent safety. In addition, the minimal knowledge of process designers regarding inherent safety hazards can exacerbate this problem. In this study, we identify the inherent safety indicators (within the period 1990–2017) used to measure the inherent safety degree of a process, and describe existing approaches to estimate these indicators. Bibliographic sites, including the Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Springer, ACS publications and Online Library, were searched based on various search strategies. A total of 62 resources were selected, and 35 indicators were found that were classified into six categories: (i) the ‘chemical and physical properties of a chemical substance (11 indicators); (ii) the ‘process conditions’ (5 indicators); (iii) the ‘equipment’ (5 indicators); (iv) the ‘reaction/decomposition properties’ (3 indicators); (v) the ‘activities and operations characteristics’ (4 indicators); and (vi) the ‘consequences’ (7 indicators). We also found six estimation approaches, including the relative rating, an advanced mathematical approach (statistical, numerical descriptive and fuzziness), the risk-based, graphical, equational (or formula) based approach and the hybrid approach. This study can provide a quick guide for non-experienced researchers being enthusiast to work on inherent safety measurements using an index-based approach. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Index-based; Indicators; Inherent safety; Measurement; Process,Chemical equipment; Chemical operations; Digital libraries; Estimation; Indicators (instruments); Measurement; Processing; Risk perception; Safety engineering; Chemical and physical properties; Chemical substance; Early design stages; Estimation approaches; Index-based; Inherent safety; Mathematical approach; Process safety indicators; Indicators (chemical),Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85041720270

The effectiveness of applied transport financing policies depends significantly on the level of agreement among stakeholders, making collaboration a prerequisite for success. The research presented herein assesses alternative financing options for urban public transportation which are based on the VCF concept. Method: The Multi - Actor Multi-Criteria Analysis (MAMCA) developed by Macharis [1] is used. The methodology is unique in its field, as it includes in-depth involvement of all relevant stakeholders and reveals their way of thinking. Results: The proposed methodological framework is applied to the real-world case study of the under construction metro system of Thessaloniki, Greece. Three different financing scenarios are tested, and the criteria weight elicitation is performed through personal interviews with 70 stakeholders belonging to six different groups, namely: Government/Local Authorities, Transport Authorities, Universities/Research Institutions, Private Sector, Society and Professional Associations. Noteworthy similarities but also contradictions among stakeholder groups emerged, highlighted by the different criteria used for each group. Conclusion: The paper introduces the MAMCA as an ex - ante evaluation method for different VCF mechanisms for urban transportation infrastructure. MAMCA emerges as a robust methodology for this assessment, as it is proved to be capable of dealing with the VCF complexity and multidisciplinary nature. © 2018, The Author(s).",Multi-actor multi-criteria analysis; Urban public transport infrastructure planning; Value capture finance,"Finance; Mass transportation; Subways; Transportation; Methodological frameworks; Multi Criteria Analysis; Professional associations; Thessaloniki , Greece; Transportation infrastructures; Urban Public Transport; Urban public transportations; Value captures; Urban transportation",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85040907244

While in the building sector issues around energy efficiency are being widely explored, CE is still a relatively new topic. This article reports on three CE pilots in the Dutch building sector and develops a collaboration tool for developing and operating circular buildings and their supply chain collaborations. First, a conceptual framework is developed to study supply chain collaboration in circular buildings, which uses theoretical building blocks for visions, actor learning, network dynamics and business model innovation. Second, a case study is presented where the framework is applied to three cases using semi-structured interviews and document analysis. Third, an empirically-based tool is developed to enhance collaboration for CE in the building sector. The cases include a newly built project, a renovation project and a demolition project. It was found that developing circular buildings requires (i) a new process design where a variety of disciplines in the supply chain is integrated upfront, (ii) the co-creation of an ambitious vision, (iii) extension of responsibilities to actors along the entire building supply chain, and (iv) new business and ownership models. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Built environment; Circular Economy; Closed loop supply chain; Industrial Ecology; Supply chain collaboration; Sustainable innovation,Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Supply chains; Built environment; Circular economy; Closed-loop supply chain; Industrial ecology; Supply chain collaboration; Buildings,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85037657872

This perspective states that policy transplants come to fit their new institutional context stepwise. This contribution reconstructs the adoption process by which the Anglo-Saxon-inspired PPP practice is incorporated into the traditional ‘Rhinelandic’ practice of infrastructure management in the Netherlands, identifying four waves of PPP initiatives. It concludes that these waves and the difficulties that emerge in them stem from an ongoing struggle between actor coalitions, one aiming to preserve the transplant in its original shape, and others making attempts at bricolage.

This represents the largest ever central government-led effort addressing transit metropolis development in the world. How has the program been implemented locally? Have the selected demonstration cities followed the same principle or taken comparable measures to implement their version of the transit metropolis? What is their performance? These questions remain unknown in the current literature. This article answers the above questions through a literature review, interviews and comparative case studies in Shenyang and Dalian, two large cities in Liaoning Province. It shows that both cities have successfully achieved the target levels for building a transit metropolis. Similarities between the two cities can be found their absence of any policies on automobile restriction and the presence of enormous efforts in transit network expansion and optimization. Differences lie in the fact that Shenyang has been more conventional in developing the transit metropolis, while Dalian has been more innovative and flexible in policy implementation. When comparing our empirical findings with the experience of creating transit metropolis elsewhere in China and in foreign countries, we find that policies and regulations restricting car use and calming traffic are not necessary conditions for successful transit metropolises; however, the attractiveness of transit infrastructure, combined with aesthetic and well-decorated street network is essential for a modal shift for transit. We also find that the perception on the transit metropolis in China more emphasizes transit service improvement, while the concept in Western countries more focuses on the shift of land use patterns that lean more towards influencing transit behavior. © 2018 MDPI AG.

'Digital Twins' in engineering provide a conceptual framework to analyze these emerging data-driven health care practices, as well as their conceptual and ethical implications for therapy, preventative care and human enhancement. Digital Twins stand for a specific engineering paradigm, where individual physical artifacts are paired with digital models that dynamically reflects the status of those artifacts. When applied to persons, Digital Twins are an emerging technology that builds on in silico representations of an individual that dynamically reflect molecular status, physiological status and life style over time. We use Digital Twins as the hypothesis that one would be in the possession of very detailed bio-physical and lifestyle information of a person over time. This perspective redefines the concept of 'normality' or 'health,' as a set of patterns that are regular for a particular individual, against the backdrop of patterns observed in the population. This perspective also will impact what is considered therapy and what is enhancement, as can be illustrated with the cases of the 'asymptomatic ill' and life extension via anti-aging medicine. These changes are the consequence of how meaning is derived, in case measurement data is available. Moral distinctions namely may be based on patterns found in these data and the meanings that are grafted on these patterns. Ethical and societal implications of Digital Twins are explored. Digital Twins imply a data-driven approach to health care. This approach has the potential to deliver significant societal benefits, and can function as a social equalizer, by allowing for effective equalizing enhancement interventions. It can as well though be a driver for inequality, given the fact that a Digital Twin might not be an accessible technology for everyone, and given the fact that patterns identified across a population of Digital Twins can lead to segmentation and discrimination. This duality calls for governance as this emerging technology matures, including measures that ensure transparency of data usage and derived benefits, and data privacy. © 2018 Bruynseels, Santoni de Sio and van den Hoven.",Digital twins; Ethics of biomedical data; Ethics of human enhancement; Personalized medicine; Privacy in healthcare technologies; Therapy; Value sensitive design in healthcare technologies; Virtual self,adult; aging; article; driver; ethics; human; life extension; lifestyle; morality; personalized medicine; privacy,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042098524

One of the most important advantages of synchromodality is the development of a sustainable transportation system. Given the numerous stakeholders and network interdependencies within freight transport corridors, achieving efficient coordination and management is complex. In this paper, we regard information exchange as one of the main enablers of collaboration between the infrastructure managers. We developed a digital single-player simulation game called “Modal Manager” comprising logistic service providers and infrastructure managers. Each player takes over the role of an infrastructure manager who must use information provision as a tool to control flows in a network where various planned and unplanned disruptions occur. We include the game in a session where participants are able to interact with the game and with each other. The first gameplay session with Dutch experts revealed that infrastructure managers perceive synchromodality as a way to cope with disruptions more efficiently. On the other hand, the concept of synchromodal corridor management is ambiguous and various legal and governance barriers exist that hinder its implementation. © 2018 by the authors.

From an editorial perspective, we argue that decentralization of energy production on the national level and that of regulatory responses to it, need more scholarly attention. In this guest editorial, the contributions of nine articles to our special issue on innovation in the European energy sector and regulatory responses to it, are addressed. First, lessons on regulatory response to innovations in European energy markets are drawn. Second, several types of responses are deduced and discussed.

Both negative and positive dispatchable balancing power plants need to balance the system. This work investigates whether parked and grid connected (Vehicle-to-Grid) Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEVs) fueled with pure hydrogen can replace positive dispatchable balancing power plants. These power plants, often gas turbine based, are likely to operate at low capacity factors in future. A simulation for a 2050 scenario is based on German 2015 renewable electricity data and assumes a passenger car mix of 40% FCEVs and 60% Battery Electric Vehicles.

Recent studies have shown that the application of different robustness metrics can result in different rankings of decision alternatives, but there has been little discussion of what potential causes for this might be. To shed some light on this issue, we present a unifying framework for the calculation of robustness metrics, which assists with understanding how robustness metrics work, when they should be used, and why they sometimes disagree. The framework categorizes the suitability of metrics to a decision-maker based on (1) the decision-context (i.e., the suitability of using absolute performance or regret), (2) the decision-maker's preferred level of risk aversion, and (3) the decision-maker's preference toward maximizing performance, minimizing variance, or some higher-order moment. This article also introduces a conceptual framework describing when relative robustness values of decision alternatives obtained using different metrics are likely to agree and disagree. This is used as a measure of how “stable” the ranking of decision alternatives is when determined using different robustness metrics. The framework is tested on three case studies, including water supply augmentation in Adelaide, Australia, the operation of a multipurpose regulated lake in Italy, and flood protection for a hypothetical river based on a reach of the river Rhine in the Netherlands. The proposed conceptual framework is confirmed by the case study results, providing insight into the reasons for disagreements between rankings obtained using different robustness metrics. © 2018 The Authors.",decision analysis; deep uncertainty; ranking stability; robustness metrics; water systems,conceptual framework; decision analysis; flood; flood control; mathematical analysis; uncertainty analysis; water supply; Adelaide; Australia; Italy; Netherlands; Rhine River; South Australia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044037973

This study extends previous work to examine the influence of wind-waves on the mouth-bar, where about half of the river-borne material settles to the bed. The site is located just outside of Changjiang River mouth, which is meso-tidal and subject to seasonally varying river flows and wind-wave conditions. Modeling was performed with a coupled wave-current hydrodynamic model using TELEMAC and TOMAWAC and validated against observed data. Bottom Shear Stress (BSS) from river, tide and waves based on the numerical model output was used to infer the respective contribution to the evolution of the subaqueous delta. Our examination did not however extend to modeling the sediment transport or the morphological bed changes. The results suggest that (i) the dominance of river discharge is limited to an area inside the mouth, while outside, the mouth-bar is tide-wave dominant; (ii) considering just the tide, the currents on the shallow shoals are flood dominant and deep channels are ebb dominant, which induces continued accretion over the shallows and erodes the deeper parts of the mouth-bar until the tidal currents become too weak to transport sediment; (iii) whereas waves are very efficient at reshaping the shallow shoals, with the effect being subtly dependent on the depth distribution over the mouth-bar; (iv) the stability of shallow shoal morphology is highly dependent on the presence of seasonal wind-waves and characterized as “summer storing and winter erosion” while deep channels perform like corridors of water and sediment, exporting sediment all year round. The nature of the mouth-bar response has important implications for coastal management, such as the ongoing deep water channel maintenance, reclamations and coastal defense measures. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Bottom shear stress; Estuary geomorphology; Mouth bar; Seasonal; Wave-current interaction; Yangtze Estuary,bar; climate effect; coastal morphology; fluvial geomorphology; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; river discharge; river flow; seasonal variation; sediment transport; shear stress; tidal current; vertical distribution; wave-current interaction; China; Yangtze Estuary,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85038907309

Improved methods are needed to guide the development of not just individual models, but also multi-model ecologies – systems of interacting models. Currently there is a lack of knowledge concerning how multi-model ecologies can and should be designed to facilitate adequate understanding of energy system complexity and its consequences. Via an analysis of twelve multi-model initiatives both within and outside the energy domain, this paper elucidates possible design patterns and development paths for multi-model ecologies. The results highlight two broad paths to developing energy system multi-model ecologies, one prioritizing interoperability and the other prioritizing diversity. The former path facilitates the efficient development of models spanning multiple scales and (to a degree) disciplines, and can ease systematic testing of assumptions. The latter is suited to bridging traditional disciplines and perspectives and advancing knowledge within the interstices of different knowledge communities. It is furthermore suggested that a combination of diversity, connectivity and hierarchy in multi-model ecology composition is central to enabling the development of complex webs of models capable of addressing the complexity of real-world energy systems. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Complexity; Energy policy; Energy systems; Modeling; Multi-model ecologies,Ecology; Energy policy; Models; Complexity; Design Patterns; Development path; Energy systems; Individual models; Knowledge communities; Multi model; Systematic testing; Interoperability,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033442767

Successful diffusion relies on the understanding, persuasion and acceptance by consumers and other stakeholders. This article investigates the views, roles and influence of stakeholders on the adoption of solar energy technology in Lebanon. The main research questions are: What are the stakeholders' views, roles and influence on the diffusion process of solar energy technologies? And are specific socio-cultural factors therein that influenced adoption? The influence of different stakeholders (end users, public representatives, banking sector, suppliers, consultants and NGOs) was assessed via qualitative data analysis, in particular semi-structured interviews. Our research perspective combines grounded and critical theoretical approaches with a case study research design allowing for a semi-inductive process to elaborate and complement new insights to the current body of literature on adoption of clean technology innovation, with a particular focus on the socio-cultural dimension. The results show that contextual factors, specifically related to the social, cultural, geographic and market dimensions, played a crucial role in shaping market development, especially in relation to the uptake of solar energy technology by different consumer groups. Based on the results of this study we argue that more scholarly attention should be awarded to the influence of the socio-cultural dimension and stakeholders' perspectives on adoption of renewable energy technology. © 2018 by the authors.

This stresses the need for a transition towards clean renewable energy systems. To enable the diffusion of cleaner energy technology it is not enough to just have supportive policies in place. The challenge is to ensure that consumers adopt them. This article integrates insights from different research traditions into a research model to analyse consumers’ adoption decision-making behaviour. The innovation-diffusion model by Rogers was used and hypotheses from environmental psychological models were later added. A survey was conducted among householders to assess the adoption of solar heating systems in the Metn neighbourhood in Lebanon (N = 200). The results revealed that adopters and non-adopters differ significantly according to socio-demographic factors, such as income and household size. The study confirmed the significance of typical variables of the diffusion of innovation model, such as relative advantage, observability, independent judgment-making, and novelty-seeking; even when testing integrative analytical models. Furthermore, the results indicate that, by integrating hypotheses from environmental psychology models to the diffusion of innovation model, a reasonable fit was achieved which is higher than the value of each model tested separately. The results can be of use to policy makers.

Most of these halls, for instance those made from stony materials, perform as predicted. However, sports halls constructed with profiled perforated steel roof panels have an unexpected very low reverberation time in the 125 and 250 Hz octave bands. The aim of this study was to provide an explanation for this low-frequency anomaly. A 1:20 scale model of a sports hall was constructed and placed in a small anechoic chamber. The roof could be equipped with differing ceiling types: a flat non-absorbing ceiling, a flat absorbing ceiling, two different profiled non-absorbing ceilings and a profiled absorbing ceiling. With a spark sound source and a small microphone, the impulse-response of the scale model could be registered and analysed. Moreover, a Matlab model was constructed to simulate the acoustic behaviour of the sports hall. This model included the ‘ground effect’ of the roof surface, an effect typically not included in commercial ray-tracing programs. The measurements and the simulations showed that the high sound absorption values of a perforated panel roof structure at 125 and 250 Hz can be (partly) explained by its shape.

Previous studies in the Chinese mega-city regions Pearl River Delta, Yangtze River Delta and Jing-Jin-Ji (region around Beijing and Tianjin) have shown that branding practices of primarily service and innovation oriented cities are largely in line with existing industrial profiles while those which are predominantly manufacturing oriented wish to present themselves as more service and innovation driven. In this contribution, city branding practices are studied in China's three Northeastern provinces Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning which face structural decline because of the presence of many outdated resource-based and heavy industries. The gap between existing profile and branding choices appears not systematic as in China's leading economic regions. Northeastern cities focus more on combining primary, secondary and tertiary industrial patterns than on displacing manufacturing with services. The tertiary sector in these provinces is more administrative and public sector oriented and generates lower value added; it is therefore not significantly more attractive than the primary and secondary ones. © 2018 by the authors.",City brand identity; City branding; City label; Developmental pathways; Ecologicalmodernization; North East China,development strategy; ecological modernization; economic conditions; industry; innovation; marketing; urban economy; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Heilongjiang; Jilin; Jingjinji; Liaoning; Tianjin; Yangtze River; Zhujiang Delta,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042534934

The purpose of this paper is to explore internal barriers that influence the effectiveness of projects within large financial services firms focussing on potentially disruptive and radical innovations. While literature has generally focused on barriers within traditional technology and manufacturing firms, few researchers have identified barriers for these type of firms. Design/methodology/approach: A framework of internal barriers was developed and validated by means of an explorative case study. Data were collected at a European bank by exploring how innovation is organized and what barriers influence effectiveness of eight innovation projects. Findings: Six items were identified as key barrier for potentially disruptive and radical innovations (e.g. traditional risk-avoidance focus, and inertia caused by systems architecture). As such, in the sample these were more important than traditionally defined barriers such as sources of finance, and lacking exploration competences. Research limitations/implications: Based on a small number of projects within one firm, the results highlight the need for more in-depth research on the effects of barriers and how barriers can be overcome within this industry. Originality/value: The results show that there is a discrepancy between the societal demand for radical change within the financial industry and the ability of large financial services firms to innovate. The study identifies which unique internal barriers hamper potentially disruptive and radical innovation in large financial services firms. © 2018, © Patrick Das, Robert Verburg, Alexander Verbraeck and Lodewijk Bonebakker.",Disruptive innovation; Financial services; Innovation barriers; Innovation projects; Radical innovation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85033582960

At the same time, decision-makers are reluctant to open their data due to some potential risks like misuse, sensitivity, ownership, and inaccuracy of the data. The goal of the study presented in this paper is to develop a Fuzzy Multi-Criteria Decision Making (FMCDM) approach to analyze the risks and benefits to determine the decision to open a dataset. FMCDM is chosen due to its capability to measure and weight the relative importance of the criteria. FMCDM need the weighting of criteria as input. For this Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) is utilized by collecting input from experts’ knowledge and expertise. The scores for each criterion are summed up to rank the importance of the alternatives. Four main criteria are used, e.g. data sensitivity and data ownership representing risks criteria, and data availability and data trustworthy as benefits criteria. For each criterion, there were two sub-criteria identified. Four types of decisions to open data can be made: completely open, maintain suppression, provide limited access, and remain closed. A health patient record dataset is used to illustrate the approach. In further research, we recommend to develop automated approaches that take a dataset as an input and can provide an advice. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2018.",Analytic hierarchy process; Benefits; Fuzzy; Multi-criteria decision making; Open data; Risks,Analytic hierarchy process; Electronic commerce; Risks; Benefits; Business innovation; Fuzzy; Fuzzy - Multi criteria decision making; Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process; Fuzzy multi criteria decision making (FMCDM); Multi criteria decision making; Open datum; Decision making,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055794607

Among them, ridesharing has received substantial attention from decision-makers around the world. Because of the multitude of currently understood or potentially unknown risks associated with ridesharing (unemployment, insurance, information privacy, and environmental risk), governments in different countries apply different strategies to address such risks. Some governments prohibit the adoption of ridesharing altogether, while other governments promote it. In this article, we address the question of how risks involved in ridesharing are governed over time. We present an in-depth single case study on Singapore and examine how the Singaporean government has addressed risks in ridesharing over time. The Singaporean government has a strong ambition to become an innovation hub, and many innovative technologies have been adopted and promoted to that end. At the same time, decision-makers in Singapore are reputed for their proactive style of social governance. The example of Singapore can be regarded as a revelatory case study, helping us further to explore governance practices in other countries. © 2018 by the authors.",Case study; Governance; Innovative technologies; Ridesharing; Risk; Singapore; Transport,Big data; Risks; Governance; Innovative technology; Ride-sharing; Singapore; Transport; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85055056256

The findings demonstrate that entrepreneurial orientation enhances innovation adoption and generation, which in turn enhance product innovation. Finally, product innovation enhances farm revenues. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the role of innovation in facilitating entrepreneurially oriented farmers to perform better when facing a dynamic market.

We base the framework on the technical functionalities of the electricity infrastructure, which we group along three dimensions: system level (from retail/distribution to transmission/wholesale), geographic scope (the connection between electricity systems) and time scales (from real-time operations and balancing markets to the investment time scale). The framework helps identify regulatory challenges—potential inefficiencies due to a lack of coordination—and to place them into context. The picture that emerges from this approach is that the institutional fragmentation of the European electricity sector will become increasingly burdensome as the development variable renewable energy requires ever closer coordination between countries, between the different levels of the electricity system and between markets that serve different time scales. Interactions between elements of market design and regulation such as congestion management, renewable energy policy and system adequacy policy affect each other and are an additional reason for a system integration approach to regulation.

Due to the fact that electric vehicle (EV) drivers charge while they park, they tend to keep the charging station occupied while not charging. This prevents others from having access. This study is the first to investigate the effect of a pricing strategy to increase the efficient use of electric vehicle charging stations. We used a stated preference survey among EV drivers to investigate the effect of a time-based fee to reduce idle time at a charging station. We tested the effect of such a fee under different scenarios and we modelled the heterogeneity among respondents using a latent class discrete choice model. We find that a fee can be very effective in increasing the efficiency at a charging station but the response to the fee varies among EV drivers depending on their current behaviour and the level of parking pressure they experience near their home. From these findings we draw implications for policy makers and charging point operators who aim to optimize the use of electric vehicle charging stations. © 2018 Rick Wolbertus and Bas Gerzon.",,Costs; Efficiency; Electric vehicles; Charging station; Discrete choice models; Electric vehicle charging; Latent class; Policy makers; Pricing strategy; Stated preference surveys; Time based; Charging (batteries),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85053679676

Ethical concerns have been voiced about a possible raise in the number of wrongs and crimes in military operations and about the creation of a ""responsibility gap"" for harms caused by these systems. To address these concerns, the principle of ""meaningful human control"" has been introduced in the legal-political debate; according to this principle, humans not computers and their algorithms should ultimately remain in control of, and thus morally responsible for, relevant decisions about (lethal) military operations. However, policy-makers and technical designers lack a detailed theory of what ""meaningful human control"" exactly means. In this paper, we lay the foundation of a philosophical account of meaningful human control, based on the concept of ""guidance control"" as elaborated in the philosophical debate on free will and moral responsibility. Following the ideals of ""Responsible Innovation"" and ""Value-sensitive Design,"" our account of meaningful human control is cast in the form of design requirements. We identify two general necessary conditions to be satisfied for an autonomous system to remain under meaningful human control: first, a ""tracking"" condition, according to which the system should be able to respond to both the relevant moral reasons of the humans designing and deploying the system and the relevant facts in the environment in which the system operates; second, a ""tracing"" condition, according to which the system should be designed in such a way as to grant the possibility to always trace back the outcome of its operations to at least one human along the chain of design and operation. As we think that meaningful human control can be one of the central notions in ethics of robotics and AI, in the last part of the paper, we start exploring the implications of our account for the design and use of non-military autonomous systems, for instance, self-driving cars. © 2018 Santoni de Sio and van den Hoven.",AI ethics; Autonomous weapon systems; Ethics of autonomous systems; Ethics of robotics; Meaningful human control; Responsibility gap; Responsible innovation in robotics; Value-sensitive design in robotics,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85050086431

Information is not shared as organizations in the supply chain do not have direct contact and/or do not want to share competitive and privacy sensitive information. In addition, companies are often part of multiple supply chains and trading partners vary over time. Blockchains are distributed ledgers in which all parties in a network can have access to data under certain conditions. Private blockchains can be used to support parties in making their demand data directly available to all other parties in their supply chain. These parties can use this data to improve their planning and reduce the bullwhip effect. However, the transparency that blockchain technology offers makes it more difficult to protect sensitive data. The dynamics between these properties are not well understood. In this paper, we design and evaluate a blockchain architecture to explore its feasibility for reducing information asymmetry, while at the same time protecting sensitive data. We found that blockchain technology can allow parties to balance their need for inventory management with their need for flexibility for changing partners.

Even though those three perspectives cover a broad range of currently relevant applications there are no widely accepted and commonly used corresponding concepts and terms. This is an obstacle to broadly understand, effectively integrate, and adequately assess such systems. We address this problem, by considering a (component-based) methodological derivation of technical (software) specifications based on underlying enterprise models. That is because context states are about the enterprise environment of a (software) system while the delivery of context-aware services is about technical (software) functionalities; hence, we need a perspective on both. We consider the SDBC (Software Derived from Business Components) approach that brings together enterprise modeling and software specification. On that basis: (a) We deliver a base context-awareness conceptualization; (b) We partially align it to agent technology because adapting behaviors to environments assumes some kind of pro-activity that is only fully covered by agent systems, in our view.

Considering the distinct prediction accuracies of the RES and load at different timescales, it is essential to incorporate the multi-timescale characteristics of BES and DR in MG energy management. Under this background, a hierarchical energy management framework is put forward for an MG including multi-timescale BES and DR to optimize operation with the uncertainty of RES as well as load. This framework comprises three stages of scheduling: day-ahead scheduling (DAS), hour-ahead scheduling (HAS), and real-time scheduling (RTS). In DAS, a scenario-based stochastic optimization model is established to minimize the expected operating cost of MG, while ensuring its safe operation. The HAS is utilized to bridge DAS and RTS. In RTS, a control strategy is proposed to eliminate the imbalanced power owing to the fluctuations of RES and load. Then, a decomposition-based algorithm is adopted to settle the models in DAS and HAS. Simulation results on a seven-bus MG validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. © 2018 by the authors.

Their effectiveness has been under scrutiny. Packaging of TDM measures has recently received much attention from researchers and governments because it can achieve more complex policy goals and resolve the negative effects of single TDM measures. Many studies have examined the concept of policy packaging, the ideal packaging process, and potential barriers at the theoretical level. However, the way TDM packaging as a concept works in a real-world context has received little attention. Additionally, there is little methodology to analyse its characteristics from a dynamic and historical perspective. Therefore, this study provides a methodology for analysing TDM packaging in four dimensions (i.e., density, classification, interaction, and time). These dimensions respectively reveal how many and what kind of TDM measures have been implemented, how they interact in a package, and how these characteristics change over time. We examine this methodology through comparative case studies based on policy document analysis in two Chinese cities, Dalian and Shenzhen, both of which adopt a large number of TDM measures. The results show that this methodology successfully reveals the characteristics of case cities: both tend to put more TDM measures into the transport policy package to deal with traffic issues, but the package in Shenzhen is more integrative than that in Dalian. We also find that with the integration of packaging increasing, transport systems are becoming more sustainable, and Shenzhen performs better in this regard than Dalian. This methodology can be used to analyse policy packaging in broader areas and to examine its influence on transport systems in more case studies in future research. © 2018 by the authors.

This requires on one hand that patients are aware of the practices being in place at the hospital and on the other hand that hospitals have the means to evaluate and adapt current practices to the needs of the patients. In this paper we apply a framework for formalizing social practices of an organization to an emergency department that carries out patient-centered planning. We indicate how such a formalization can be used to answer operational queries about the expected outcome of operational actions.

To integrate FCEVs through vehicle-to-grid (V2G), agreements are needed between the FCEV owners and the actor that coordinates V2G on behalf of them, usually considered the aggregator. In this paper, we argue that, depending on the purpose of providing V2G and the goal of the system or the aggregator, different types of contracts are needed, not currently considered in the literature. We propose price-based, volume-based, and control-based contracts. Using agent-based modeling and simulation we show how price-based contracts can be applied for selling V2G in the wholesale electricity market and how volume-based contracts can be used for balancing the local energy supply and demand in a microgrid. The models can provide a base to explore strategies in the market and to improve performance in a system highly dependent on V2G. © 2018 Esther H.

It has become a product that is shared for multiple purposes such as situational awareness, decision-making, coordination, reporting, and attracting funding. In the aftermath of sudden onset disasters, humanitarians are constrained with huge workload, time pressure, and uncertainties and thus, information products are often criticized with respect to quality issues. In this paper, we aim at developing an empirically grounded framework that can measure the quality of information products through accuracy, objectivity, completeness, and consistency. We validate the framework with the help of practitioners and apply it to the information products of UN WFP for the 2015 Nepal earthquake response.

Instead of using a wind turbine, these systems use a kite to generate energy. Commercializing such new high-tech systems is a risky strategy, the failure rate is high. This chapter identifies barriers that block large-scale diffusion of kite-based airborne wind energy systems and specific niche strategies to deal with these barriers. The results are based upon literature research and interviews with six academic and industry experts active in the field of airborne wind energy. We identified the most important barriers to large-scale implementation of airborne wind energy. We show how particular barriers, such as the lack of knowledge of the technology and the lack of support and investment opportunities, interact and together block large-scale production and diffusion. The second result is that several niche strategies can be identified to tackle the barriers in this field. The “geographic niche strategy”, the “demo, experiment and develop niche strategy” and the “educate niche strategy” are identified as good strategies to introduce the kite-based systems. The chapter ends with a discussion of these niche strategies and how they relate to previous research into introduction of sustainable energy technologies. © 2018, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",,Failure analysis; Wind power; Failure rate; Industry experts; Investment opportunities; Large scale productions; Literature researches; Niche strategies; Sustainable energy technology; Wind energy systems; Investments,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044822358

This in turn can enable information systems which capture the “current” user state and act accordingly. The use of this data would result in context-aware applications that get fueled by user data (and environmental data) to adapt their behavior. Yet the use of data is often restricted by privacy regulations and norms; for example, the location of a person cannot be shared without given consent. In this paper we propose a design approach that allows for weaving context-awareness and privacy-by-design into the specification of information systems. This is to be done since the very early stages of the software development, while the enterprise needs are captured (and understood) and the software features are specified on that basis. In addition to taking into account context-awareness and privacy-sensitivity these two aspects will be balanced, especially if they are conflicting. The presented approach extends the “Software Derived from Business Components” (SDBC) approach. We partially demonstrate our proposed way of modeling, by means of a case example featuring land border security. Our proposed way of modeling would allow developers to smoothly reflect context and privacy features in the application design, supported by methodological guidelines that span over the enterprise modeling and software specification. Those features are captured as technology-independent societal demands and are in the end reflected in technology-specific (software) solutions. Traceability between the two is possible as well as re-use of modeling constructs. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.",Context-awareness; Enterprise modeling; Privacy; Software specification,Data privacy; Domestic appliances; Enterprise software; Information systems; Information use; Specifications; Systems engineering; Business component; Context- awareness; Enterprise modeling; Environmental data; Methodological guidelines; Modeling construct; Software Specification; Technology independent; Software design,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85044450229

With the rise of context-aware systems, designers are struggling with what variables should be sensed from the context. According to the definitions found in the literature, whether something belongs to context, has to do with whether it is relevant. However, what it means to be relevant is left implicit in these definitions. Most work on context-aware systems is based on assumptions of the context that should be taken into account. Hence, it is unclear how to decide whether something belongs to context or should be left out. In this paper, first we analyse what is meant with context and provide a definition. In this definition we introduce the notion of a context variable, defined as an attribute of an object that is relevant. Context is then defined as the set of context variables. We establish explicit criteria for deciding whether an attribute of an object is a context variable based on the proposed definition and the designer’s goal. We also provide a straightforward method to help designers to determine whether the criterion is met and a variable should be included in the context. This method is based on filling out a scheme to describe context variables. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.",Business-to-government; Context; Context relationship; Context variable; Context-aware systems; Information sharing,Formal methods; Software engineering; Context; Context relationship; Context variables; Context-aware systems; Information sharing; User interfaces,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85042136618

The objective of this paper is to explore the characteristics of this niche in relation to a range of existing modelling approaches and literatures with which it shares commonalities or from which it could draw. We distil a number of key aspects we think a transitions model should be able to address, from a broadly acknowledged, empirical list of transition characteristics. We review some of the main strands in modelling of socio-technological change with regards to their ability to address these characteristics. These are: Eco-innovation literatures (energy-economy models and Integrated Assessment Models), evolutionary economics, complex systems models, computational social science simulations using agent based models, system dynamics models and socio-ecological systems models. The modelling approaches reviewed can address many of the features that differentiate sustainability transitions from other socio-economic dynamics or innovations. The most problematic features are the representation of qualitatively different system states and of the normative aspects of change. The comparison provides transition researchers with a starting point for their choice of a modelling approach, whose characteristics should correspond to the characteristics of the research question they face. A promising line of research is to develop innovative models of co-evolution of behaviours and technologies towards sustainability, involving change in the structure of the societal and technical systems. © 2018, University of Surrey.

The time needed for escalation to take place allows emergency actions as a response to the primary fire to prevent the propagation of the fire.

Although CCU could reduce fossil resource demand, its capability as a climate change mitigation option is under debate. In contrast to single-product CCU, this prospective study explores the techno-economic and environmental feasibility of novel systems that include more than one CO2 utilisation product. The combination of multi-product CCU with CO2 storage is also investigated. Two configurations have been designed, in which CO2 is captured in a refinery and converted into dimethyl ether (DME) and polyols, simultaneously (parallel configuration) or in two consecutive cycles (cascade configuration). Compared to a reference system without capture, results show that the largest direct CO2 emission reductions are achieved with CCS without utilisation (−70%) but at the expenses of higher total costs (+7%). Multi-product CCU systems show lower fossil depletion and costs than the reference without capture (−10% and −9%, respectively) because of feedstock replacement by the CO2 utilised. Combination of multi-product CCU with storage turns to be the best alternative for reduced climate change potential (−18% relative to the reference) while still been economically feasible. In addition to lower upstream emissions due to fossil feedstock replacement by utilising CO2, process direct emissions diminish owing to storage. No significant differences were found between the cascade and the parallel configurations. The extra effort to recycle CO2 in the cascade configurations is neither penalised nor rewarded. © 2017 The Authors",Cascade and parallel configurations; Closing carbon cycles; Dimethyl ether; Life cycle assessment; Multi-product CO2 utilisation; Polyol,Alcohols; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Emission control; Ethers; Feedstocks; Fuels; Refining; Carbon cycles; Dimethyl ethers; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi-products; Parallel configuration; Polyol; Life cycle,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85036472256

Being able to model intelligent interactions between adaptive adversaries and defenders is the main advantage of game theory, while the main criticisms of the usage of game theory is that it is mathematically complicated and that it over-simplifies reality. The ANSI/API standard 780 on Security Risk Assessment for the petroleum and petrochemical industries (abbreviated as the “API SRA methodology”), conversely, provides a systematic approach for obtaining qualitative or semi-quantitative data, and is criticized on its failure at modelling strategic (and intelligent) adversaries. Integration of game theory and the API SRA methodology for improving chemical plant protection is therefore an interesting domain of study. In this paper, the API SRA methodology bridges the gap between “chemical security reality” and “chemical security theory (that is, game theoretic models)”, by providing quantitative inputs for game theoretic models and by reflecting on game theoretic results with respect to industrial practice. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",ANSI/API standard 780; Chemical plant protection; Game theory; Security risk assessment,Chemical plants; Chemicals; Petroleum industry; Risk assessment; Adaptive adversary; ANSI/API standard 780; Game-theoretic model; Industrial practices; Intelligent interactions; Petrochemical industry; Plant protection; Security risk assessments; Game theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035324487

Each level is represented by its own fleet size, its own technology maturity and its own average purchase price and utility. These components form the core of the model. The feedback loops between the components form a dynamic behavior that influences the diffusion of AVs. The model was applied to the Netherlands both for a base and an optimistic scenario (strong political support and technology development) named “AV in-bloom”. In these experiments, we found that the system is highly uncertain with market penetration varying greatly with the scenarios and policies adopted. Having an ‘AV in bloom’ eco-system for AVs is connected with a great acceleration of the market take-up of high levels of automation. As a policy instrument, a focus on more knowledge transfer and the creation of an external fund (e.g. private investment funds or European research funds) has shown to be most effective to realize a positive innovation diffusion for AVs. Providing subsidies may be less effective as these give a short-term impulse to a higher market penetration, but will not be able to create a higher market surplus for vehicle automation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Automatic vehicles; Demand forecasting; Innovation diffusion; Learning effects; System dynamics,Blooms (metal); Commerce; Diffusion; Investments; Knowledge management; System theory; Technological forecasting; Vehicles; Automatic vehicles; Demand forecasting; Innovation diffusion; Learning effects; System Dynamics; Automation; automation; computer simulation; demand analysis; forecasting method; innovation; quantitative analysis; technology diffusion; transport vehicle; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85035094549

Seventy-four scenarios were extracted from 4 books on social engineering (written by social engineers) and analysed. Each scenario was split into attack steps, containing single interactions between offender and target. For each attack step, persuasion principles were identified. The main findings are that (a) persuasion principles are often used in social engineering attacks, (b) authority (1 of the 6 persuasion principles) is used considerably more often than others, and (c) single-principle attack steps occur more often than multiple-principle ones. The social engineers identified in the scenarios more often used persuasion principles compared to other social influences. The scenario analysis illustrates how to exploit the human element in security. The findings support the view that security mechanisms should include not only technical but also social countermeasures.

However, a more realistic attack is essentially an attack with limited adversarial knowledge of the system model and limited attack resources due to various reasons. In this paper, we generalize the data attacks that they can be pure FDI attacks or combined with availability attacks (e.g., DoS attacks) and analyze the attacks with limited adversarial knowledge or limited attack resources. The attack impact is evaluated by the proposed metrics and the detection probability of attacks is calculated using the distribution property of data with or without attacks. The analysis is supported with results from a power system use case. The results show how important the knowledge is to the attacker and which measurements are more vulnerable to attacks with limited resources. © 2017 IEEE.",,Denial-of-service attack; Probability distributions; Bad data detections; Coordinate measurements; Data integrity attacks; Detection probabilities; Distribution property; False data injection; Power system state estimation; System modeling; Industrial electronics,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85046664703

It examines the features that constitute restaurant authenticity and determines whether these can be standardised within an alliance of top restaurants to reap the benefits of commonalities among the restaurants. We determine the features of authenticity by examining the literature, by interviewing owners and managers of alliance restaurants and by means of a consumer survey. The results show several discrepancies. Combining these three data sources allowed us to distinguish between essential and peripheral features of authenticity. This distinction can help to define a standard for restaurant authenticity, specifying minimum levels for essential features of authenticity. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Authenticity; common branding; restaurant; standardisation,food industry; industrial performance; literature review; service sector; standard (reference),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030246335

The main challenges for H-shaped platform-control include synchronous control between the two linear motors in the Y direction as well as total positioning error of the platform mover, a combination of position deviation in X and Y directions. To deal with the above challenges, this paper proposes a control strategy based on the inverse system method through state feedback and dynamic decoupling of the thrust force. First, mechanical dynamics equations have been deduced through the analysis of system coupling based on the platform structure. Second, the mathematical model of the linear motors and the relevant coordinate transformation between dq-axis currents and ABC-phase currents are analyzed. Third, after the main concept of inverse system method being explained, the inverse system model of the platform control system has been designed after defining relevant system variables. Inverse system model compensates the original nonlinear coupled system into pseudo-linear decoupled linear system, for which typical linear control methods, like PID, can be adopted to control the system. The simulation model of the control system is built in MATLAB/Simulink and the simulation result shows that the designed control system has both small synchronous deviation and small total trajectory tracking error. Furthermore, the control program has been run on NI controller for both fixed-loop-time and free-loop-time modes, and the test result shows that the average loop computation time needed is rather small, which makes it suitable for real industrial applications. Overall, it proves that the proposed new control strategy can be used in industrial applications that have high-precision and high real-time performance requirements. © 2017 by the authors.

An agent-based model is used for this analysis. Capacity markets can compensate for the deteriorating incentive to invest in controllable power plants when the share of variable renewable energy sources grows, but may create volatile prices themselves. Capacity markets with long-term contracts have been developed, e.g. in the UK, to stabilize capacity prices. In our analysis, a FCM is effective in providing the required adequacy level and leads to lower cost to consumers and more stable capacity prices, as compared to a yearly capacity market. In case of a demand shock, a FCM may develop an investment cycle, but it still maintains security of supply. Its main effect on the power plant portfolio is more investment in peak plant. © 2017 The Author(s)",Adequacy policy; Agent-based modeling; Capacity markets; Capacity mechanisms; Electricity market; Security of supply,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Electric industry; Energy security; Power markets; Renewable energy resources; Agent-based model; Capacity markets; Investment cycle; Long-term contracts; Power plant portfolio; Renewable energies; Security of supply; Variable renewable energies; Investments; demand elasticity; electricity supply; energy market; incentive; investment; modeling; price dynamics; renewable resource; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032502329

Centralized methods of anomaly detection are subject to inherent constraints: (1) they create a communication burden on the system, (2) they impose a delay in detection while information is being gathered, and (3) they require some trust and/or sharing of traffic information patterns. On the other hand, truly parallel, distributed methods are fast and private but can observe only local information. These methods can easily fail to see the “big picture” as they focus on only one thread in a tapestry. A recently proposed algorithm, Distributed Intrusion/Anomaly Monitoring for Nonparametric Detection (DIAMoND), addressed these problems by using parallel surveillance that included dynamic detection thresholds. These thresholds were functions of nonparametric information shared among network neighbors. Here, we explore the influence of network topology and patterns in normal traffic flow on the performance of the DIAMoND algorithm. We contrast performance to a truly parallel, independent surveillance system. We show that incorporation of nonparametric data improves anomaly detection capabilities in most cases, without incurring the practical problems of fully parallel network surveillance. © 2017, The Author(s).",Anomaly detection; DDoS attack; Information sharing; Simulation,Denial-of-service attack; Information analysis; Intrusion detection; Monitoring; Signal detection; Topology; Traffic control; Anomaly detection; DDoS Attack; Distributed methods; Information sharing; Nonparametric detection; Simulation; Surveillance systems; Traffic information; Information dissemination,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014725780

One of the main modus operandi is financial malware that compromises consumer and corporate devices, thereby potentially undermining the security of critical financial systems. Recent research into the underground economy has shown that cybercriminals are organised around highly specialised tasks, such as pay-per-install markets for infected machines, malware-as-a-service and money mule recruitment. Setting up a successful financial malware scheme requires the aligning of many moving parts. Analysing how cybercrime groups acquire, combine and align these parts into value chains can greatly benefit from existing insights into the economics of online crime.

The presence of major hazard and risk control via well-established safety management systems in the process industry offers a unique opportunity to add safety via nudges. Psychology and behavioural economics have already entered the safety science realm. Behaviour-based safety emerged in the early nineteen eighties and is in need of an upgrade. Where conscious behaviour according to unwritten cultural rules and written instructions are not enough for safety, additional manipulation of unconsciously made choices might be used. This principle, which is called a ‘nudge’ towards desirable behaviour, is already being applied in e.g. traffic control, public space, politics, energy saving, health care and trade practice. Nudging may have uncertainties about its feasibility and magnitude of its effects, might be developed specifically for certain application areas, might raise ethical concerns and – hence – requires investigation of its application boundaries. The potential of improving safety this way resides in the human error domain and may not only reduce hitherto unaffected unsafe behaviour but also increase rule compliance on legislation, procedures and codes of conduct. This article explores ‘safety nudges’ and proposes a new safety management tool for influencing behaviour of workers in safety controlled environments in the process industry. Based on currently available evidence, a set of 9 nudge types and an implementation approach are proposed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Behaviour-based safety; Behavioural economics; Chemical industry; Nudge; Process industry,Behavioral research; Chemical industry; Economics; Energy conservation; Human resource management; Industrial economics; Process control; Process design; Safety engineering; Traffic control; Controlled environment; Implementation approach; Nudge; Process industries; Process safety indicators; Safety equipments; Safety management; Safety management systems; Accident prevention,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85032871164

Impact assessments of information technology are also often limited to privacy impact assessments, which are focused on individual rights and well-being, as opposed to the social environment. In this article, I argue that this perspective is too narrow, in terms of understanding the complexity of the relation between information technology and society, as well as in terms of directions for managing this relation. I use systems theory to show that current approaches focus mostly on individual impact of information technology developments rather than their mediating role in society itself. I argue that this should be complemented by an analysis of impact on individuals (psychic systems) via co-construction of the environment (social system). I then take up the question of what the role of information technology in social systems would look like in terms of the social relations of trust and power, and how this can complement privacy in discussions on impacts of information technology. © 2017, Published with license by Taylor & Francis © 2017, © Wolter Pieters.",Impact assessment; information technology; privacy; social sustainability; social systems; systems theory,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85030646960

The first axis (“market vs. regulation”) measures faith in the invisible hand to adjust the natural thermostat. The second axis expresses differences in views on the efficiency and equity implications of climate action. The two axes combined lead to a classification of conflicting approaches in climate economics.

However, existing regulations on controlling atmospheric pollutants, and the enforcement of these regulations, often are insufficient in such countries. As a result, the deterioration of surrounding ecosystems and a quality decrease of the atmospheric environment can be observed. Previous works in this domain fail to generate executable and pragmatic solutions for inspection agencies due to practical challenges. In addressing these challenges, we introduce a so-called Chemical Plant Environment Protection Game (CPEP) to generate reasonable schedules of high-accuracy air quality monitoring stations (i.e., daily management plans) for inspection agencies. First, so-called Stackelberg Security Games (SSGs) in conjunction with source estimation methods are applied into this research. Second, high-accuracy air quality monitoring stations as well as gas sensor modules are modeled in the CPEP game. Third, simplified data analysis on the regularly discharging of chemical plants is utilized to construct the CPEP game. Finally, an illustrative case study is used to investigate the effectiveness of the CPEP game, and a realistic case study is conducted to illustrate how the models and algorithms being proposed in this paper, work in daily practice. Results show that playing a CPEP game can reduce operational costs of high-accuracy air quality monitoring stations. Moreover, evidence suggests that playing the game leads to more compliance from the chemical plants towards the inspection agencies. Therefore, the CPEP game is able to assist the environmental protection authorities in daily management work and reduce the potential risks of gaseous pollutants dispersion incidents. © 2017 by the authors.

These approaches focus on covering a wide variety of scenarios and searching for robust strategies. However, they generally do not take the multiplicity of stakeholder perspectives into account in analytic terms, which could bring in diverse opinions and views, not only on possible futures but also on values and interests. In this study, we present an approach to incorporate stakeholder perspectives into model-based scenarios for exploring the future dynamics of the Dutch gas sector. The results demonstrate that the scenario space can be demarcated according to the perspectives. This allows for a systematic comparison of the perspectives and provides a basis for identification of robust strategies. Also, the analysis shows that incompatible elements between the model and perspectives, or within perspectives can be identified. This provides insights about the problem complexity and potential barriers to the futures envisioned by the perspectives. Future research can strengthen this approach by involving stakeholders in modelling and in the model-based representation of the perspective narratives to enhance learning and credibility, and can extend the analysis to identify (socially) robust policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Deep uncertainty; Energy futures; Exploratory modeling and analysis; Exploratory scenarios; Stakeholder perspectives,future prospect; gas industry; modeling; perception; stakeholder; uncertainty analysis; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028696452

CO2 can be used as feedstock in the synthesis of fuels, chemicals and polymers. This study presents a prospective assessment of carbon capture from a hydrogen unit at a refinery, where the CO2 is either stored, or partly stored and partly utilised for polyols production. A methodology integrating technical, economic and environmental models with uncertainty analysis is used to assess the performance of carbon capture and storage or utilisation at the refinery. Results show that only 10% of the CO2 captured from an industrial hydrogen unit can be utilised in a commercial-scale polyol plant. This option has limited potential for large scale CO2 mitigation from industrial sources. However, CO2 capture from a hydrogen unit and its utilisation for the synthesis of polyols provides an interesting alternative from an economic perspective. The costs of CO2-based polyol are estimated at 1200 €/t polyol, 16% lower than those of conventional polyol. Furthermore, the costs of storing the remaining CO2 are offset by the benefits of cheaper polyol production. Therefore, the combination of CO2 capture and partial utilisation provides an improved business case over capture and storage alone. The environmental assessment shows that the climate change potential of this CO2 utilisation system is 23% lower compared to a reference case in which no CO2 is captured at the refinery. Five other environmental impact categories included in this study present slightly better performance for the utilisation case than for the reference case. © 2015 The Authors.

Standardisation plays a key role in shaping the rules that govern these developments and their effects on society. Due to the large variety of actors involved in these trends, the associated standardisation processes are likely to involve all three modes of standardisation identified in the literature: committee-based, market-based and government-based. This multi-mode standardisation challenges the theoretical views on standardisation which predominantly focus on one of the modes. In this paper, we review the existing literatures on individual modes and on multi-mode standardisation. By recombining existing evidence, we generate new insights into multi-mode standardisation processes. These first insights relate to the contributions that each mode can make to such processes’ outcomes and suggest that their impact depends on factors, such as their initiation's timing and the institutional context in which the standardisation process occurs. Moreover, we consider the conditions under which actors can launch each mode. Based on our observations, we formulate an agenda for future research to obtain a better understanding of multi-mode standardisation. We offer recommendations for industry actors, NGOs, researchers and policy makers involved in shaping technological and societal change. © 2017 The Author(s)",Committee-based standardization; Government-based standardization; Multi-mode standardization; Regulation; Standard battles; Standardization,Large scale systems; Critical review; Institutional contexts; Large-scale complex systems; Multimodes; Policy makers; Regulation; Research agenda; Societal changes; Standardization,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021838623

We do so by distinguishing two interacting trajectories of assessment: a formal trajectory that is embedded in the legal system and an informal trajectory that is mainly embedded in public discourse. The emergence of an informal assessment trajectory can be seen as a response to a (perceived) lack of attention to particular concerns or values in the formal trajectory, i.e. ‘overflowing’. The emerging informal assessment may subsequently lead to adaptations in the formal trajectory, which we refer to as ‘backflowing'. Based on insights from case studies on Dutch energy projects and literature on energy justice we identify three justice-related attributes that facilitate understanding of the emergence of controversies. These attributes are based on differences between the two trajectories in terms of 1) the way in which values are expressed, 2) the dimension of energy justice that is taken as a starting point, and 3) the democratic legitimization of assessment trajectories. In order to allow for legitimate and effective energy policy, overflowing and backflowing need to be addressed as interrelated rather than as separate processes. © 2017 The Authors",Assessment trajectories; Controversy; Dutch energy projects; Energy justice; Legitimate decision-making; Overflowing,Energy policy; Case-studies; Controversy; Effective energy; Energy justices; Energy project; Informal assessments; Legal system; Overflowing; Trajectories; decision making; energy policy; informal sector; legal system; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021056943

Short of legal obligations, we discuss the effectiveness and moral legitimacy of voluntary approaches based on naming and shaming. We argue that effectiveness and legitimacy are closely tied together; as voluntary approaches are the only alternative to legally imposed duties, they are most morally defensible particularly if they would be the most effective in reducing the harmful greenhouse gases. Shaming could be made effective if states could prompt more corporations to accept voluntary cuts with high gains—such as public acknowledgements—and high losses, such as reporting on noncompliance and public exposure (naming), along with some kind of condemnation (shaming). An important challenge of such voluntary approaches is how to ensure compliance with the agreed upon commitments, while avoiding greenwashing or selective disclosure. Certain institutional arrangements are inevitable, including an independent measurement, monitoring and verification mechanism. In this paper, we discuss the potentials and ethical pitfalls of shaming as a strategy when corporations have a direct relationship with consumers, but also when they are in a relationship with governments and other corporations. © 2017, The Author(s).",Climate change; Corporate social responsibility; Environmental management; INDC; Multinational corporations; Naming and shaming,climate; climate change; commercial phenomena; cooperation; government; greenhouse gas; human; interpersonal communication; morality; organization; shame; social psychology; voluntary program; Climate; Climate Change; Commerce; Cooperative Behavior; Disclosure; Government; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Morals; Organizations; Shame; Social Values; Voluntary Programs,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017414991

This study presents an overview of the literature on HVs, focusing on the three topics that dominate the policy debate on transport: environmental, safety and congestion impacts. We observed that polluting emissions of HVs are per kilometre much higher (often a factor 5 or more) than those of moderns vehicles. The annual average mileage per vehicle per year of HVs is much lower than other vehicles. The lower active and passive safety levels of HVs are compensated by the way these vehicles are driven, resulting in the risk factors per kilometre being roughly equal or lower than other vehicles. The contribution of HVs to congestion is negligible. However, the transport policy discourse is divided on the topic of HVs. More comprehensive and effective laws and regulation are needed to protect this aspect of the heritage of road transport whilst concurrently avoiding or limiting the problems caused by them. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",congestion; environment; Historic vehicles; noise; policy; safety,environmental impact; noise pollution; regulatory framework; road transport; traffic congestion; traffic emission; transport vehicle; transportation policy; transportation safety,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85010676714

If such conceptual innovation is to contribute to a coherent conception of RI, however, it is crucial to better understand the relation between responsibility and innovation first. This paper elucidates this relation by locating responsibility and innovation within Emmanuel Levinas’ phenomenology. It structures his work into three ‘stages’, each described in terms of their leading experience and objectivation regime. This analysis identifies a need for constant innovation of political and technological systems, originating from and motivated by our responsibility to others. It also shows the relation between responsibility and innovation to be threefold: foundational, ethical and structural. These insights could help RI to avoid some pitfalls of ‘regular’ innovation, and provide moral grounding for important aspects of RI. © 2017 The Author(s).

Recent literature suggests performance benefits from combining these innovations. Within supply chain (SC) partnerships, that use BIM–hereinafter called BIM-enabled SC partnerships–various formal and informal dimensions influence the inter-organizational relations. To understand such partnerships, a mixed method approach featuring case studies and social networks analysis (SNA) was deployed. SNA was an analytic approach to explore the complex relations within two Dutch BIM-enabled projects. The inter-organizational relations were asymmetrical and formal in Case A, emphasizing transactions, whereas in Case B, they were asymmetrical and informal, emphasizing relations. The transactional-oriented partnership had greater control over contractual issues, but their formal relations were not sufficient for diffusing BIM-related knowledge across the chain. Conversely, the relational-oriented partnership engaged the partners in BIM by informal means, e.g. dense communication and BIM-related peer-learning across all tiers. Symmetric and jointly fostered formal and informal relations contribute to SC integration. The study extends the knowledge base of SCM and BIM, by offering real-world data on their combination. Besides providing new insights into SNA deployment for BIM-related research, it also offers a novel constructivist and inter-organizational perspective on the old concept of SCM. © 2017 The Author(s).

Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent to which cities and local governments can cope with the challenges of climate change mitigation. The purpose of the research is to find out the extent to which local air pollution reduction policies can contribute to the climate change mitigation program. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The study evaluated the air quality improvement and the climate change mitigation programs using the actor-based framework of the Contextual Interaction Theory (CIT). The governance and stakeholder characteristic of climate change mitigation were also analysed using the structural context part of the CIT framework. The result shows that air quality improvement policy is implemented separately from climate policy; the latter operates at the national level and the former at the local level. By looking at the actor interaction analysis, the study concludes that a more holistic environmental policy approach would be more efficient at reducing local air pollution and contributing to the mitigation of climate change. © 2017 by the authors.

To address this question we present a critical assessment of the often exaggerated benefits of blockchain technology found in the literature and discuss their implications for governmental organizations and processes. We plea for a shift from a technology-driven to need-driven approach in which blockchain applications are customized to ensure a fit with requirements of administrative processes and in which the administrative processes are changed to benefit from the technology.

Various types of use were identified. Politicians use CBA: (1) When forming their opinion about the desirability of transport projects; (2) As political ammunition (opportunistic use); (3) To make themselves and their decisions look more rational (symbolic use). None of the politicians stated that they solely base their judgment on CBAs. Politicians mention seven barriers that hamper the use of CBA when forming their opinion: (1) The process of forming an opinion is trivial; (2) Politicians prefer to form their opinion based on conversations rather than on reading reports; (3) Politicians don’t trust CBA’s impartiality; (4) Politicians disagree with normative choices made in CBA. An example of such a normative choice is that CBA attaches an equally large weight to everybody’s utility changes. (5) Politicians think that CBA’s explanatory power is limited; (6) Politicians receive CBAs too late; (7) When there is plenty of money, politicians care less about a project’s social profitability. Members of Parliament identified barriers 3 and 6 as the most important barriers. They regard publishing CBAs one or two months before a debate as the most auspicious solution for rectifying these barriers. An interesting observation is that no barriers for the opportunistic and symbolic use of CBA by politicians were identified. Hence, it can be concluded that it is highly likely that when politicians receive CBAs for transport projects, they will use the CBA in an opportunistic and symbolic way, but politicians will not necessarily use CBA when forming their opinion. © 2016, The Author(s).",Cost–benefit analysis (CBA); Decision–making process; Knowledge utilization; Transport appraisal; Transport planning,Costs; Benefit analysis; Knowledge utilization; Making process; Transport appraisals; Transport planning; Cost benefit analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85028043510

Due to the increased attention for security issues, an optimal allocation of security measures, including related cost issues, becomes progressively more important. Despite the existence of economic models for supporting decision-making processes in general, for instance cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analyses, no specific economic models are available in the domain of operational security (including counter-terrorism decision-making) to be applied within the chemical and process industry. In this study, a novel method for cost-benefit and cost-effectiveness analysis for the allocation of physical security measures was elaborated and tested using a case study. Starting from a site-specific analysis of the baseline physical security system performance, the model allows comparing and evaluating the costs of different security upgrades with the (hypothetical) benefits related to the avoided losses. The approach developed enables selecting economically feasible security measures, or a combination of such measures with a maximum net present value, within the budget constraints of a chemical plant. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Chemical industry; Process industry; Security cost-benefit analysis; Security cost-effectiveness analysis; Security decision-making,Budget control; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Chemical plants; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Industrial economics; Terrorism; Cost effectiveness analysis; Decision making process; Economic modeling; Operational security; Optimal allocation; Physical security systems; Process industries; Security decision makings; Cost benefit analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85021081038

Because standards are a prerequisite for deployment, the US federal government - in a departure from established hands-off practice - intervened to coordinate and accelerate standardization activities. This research uses narrative analysis to explore how such a policy of intervention was constructed. What emerges has elements of a hero story, describing a situation to be remedied: an aging electricity grid, plagued by blackouts and modernization hampered by an electric utility industry composed by stand-alone “silos”. In contrast, the vision of a future “smart grid” with promises of improved energy security, reduced carbon emissions, renewable resources, “green innovation” and jobs. The threat: without standards, the risk that sizable public investments become obsolete prematurely. The villain: unnamed companies engaging in uncompetitive behavior. The unlikely hero: The National Institute of Standards and Technology, able to act as an “honest broker”, proving that the government can as “catalyst” in partnership with industry. While succeeding in making a strong argument for government intervention, the story can be criticized for making exaggerated claims about the effects of standards, for downplaying the complexity of the process and for failure to outline policy alternatives beyond a five-year plan. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Energy policy; Narrative analysis; Smart grid; Standardization,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020768262

The narrative is written by the first author, retired as an inspector mid-2016. The concept ‘narrative’ was reviewed, debated and methodically interpreted by the second author. The narrative story considers risk assessment as the current basis for successful prevention and sound safety management, in line with current thinking. An inventory of risks for society, workers and environment, originating from a company that is eligible to receive a licence to operate, is essential for the regulator's decision-making. It needs to cover all risks since acceptance of incomplete assessments imply implicitly accepted, yet uncontrolled, danger. Risk inventories in practice tend to be elaborate yet incomplete. Shortcomings identified via assessment by the regulator, are mainly found in the areas of known but ignored danger, lacking evidence for chance and effect, lacking underpinning of the completeness of the inventory and lacking checks whether as yet unknown danger of various types could be threatening safety. This study has three results: an exploration of current thinking about risk based regulatory approach as described in literature, an experts' narrative on pitfalls in regulatory practice and an analysis leading to new insights about incomplete risk assessments. Conclusion is that progressing towards validation of company risk assessments by the regulator would require more uniformity of company risk assessments, a standard regulator appraisal method and, as an additional safeguard, a systematically performed completeness check. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Appraisal; Assessment; Regulator; Risk; Safety; Validation,Accident prevention; Decision making; Risks; Safety engineering; Appraisal; Appraisal method; Assessment; Longitudinal case study; Major hazards; Regulator; Safety management; Validation; Risk assessment,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013876365

Regional population density significantly affects the number of steps after controlling for individual and household attributes. The estimated population density that maximizes the number of steps is around 11,000 persons/km2. Increasing densities, up to levels of around 11,000 inhabitants/km2, could increase walking and consequently the health of inhabitants.

Different types of experimental designs that underlie such surveys have been used in practice. In unlabelled experiments, where all alternatives are described by the same generic utility function, such designs may suffer from choice tasks containing a dominant alternative. Also in labelled experiments with alternative specific attributes and constants such dominance may occur, but to a lesser extent. We show that dominant alternatives are problematic because they affect scale and may bias parameter estimates. We propose a new measure based on minimum regret to calculate dominance and automatically detect such choice tasks in an experimental design or existing dataset. This measure is then used to define a new experimental design type that removes dominance and ensures the making of trade-offs between attributes. Finally, we propose a new regret-scaled multinomial logit model that takes the level of dominance within a choice task into account. Results using simulated and empirical data show that the presence of dominant alternatives can bias model estimates, but by making scale a function of a smooth approximation of normalised minimum regret we can properly account for scale differences without the need to remove choice tasks with dominant alternatives from the dataset. © 2017",Discrete choice; Dominant alternatives; Regret; Scale; Stated choice experiments,Decision theory; Economic and social effects; Statistics; Surveys; Discrete choice; Dominant alternatives; Regret; Scale; Stated choice experiments; Design of experiments; discrete choice analysis; experimental study; modeling,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019461739

This is needed because nuclear energy production is likely to grow and new reactors will have different global dispersal, veering towards less experienced countries. In addition, there is growing interest in international and multilateral collaboration on disposal of mounting nuclear waste. Unlike existing improvements that came in response to nuclear disasters (by accident), it makes sense to implement all these elements at once (by design). While a comprehensive global governance regime must include elements of verification and enforcement, more transparent international oversight would also improve global nuclear safety through public pressure. The monitoring and enforcement of such a globally organized regime could be introduced at regional or otherwise supranational level. In this paper, we argue that a robust global nuclear safety regime is not only necessary but also feasible provided it manages to address the following potential hurdles: i) the tensions in international security politics, ii) the stickiness of national sovereignty and iii) industry resistance to additional restrictions and to issues of proprietary commercial information.

Instrumental in increasing the awareness and understanding about sustainability issues and improving people's behaviour regarding sustainability issues is sustainability education. However, sustainability education is not yet widespread and is found to not always be effective in tackling people's behavioural aspects regarding sustainability issues. This paper addresses a novel form of sustainability education that has potentially both a wide reach and tackles behavioural aspects of sustainability issues directly: serious gaming. It is shown how an entertainment game, a scenario expansion for the popular board-game Settlers of Catan, can be used to educate a broad audience on sustainability issues. Through a causal analysis of the educational mechanisms embedded in the game scenario the strategies that players might use were found. Subsequently, workshops were held to observe how players are affected by playing the game. The results suggest that playing the game affects people's attitude towards sustainability and, predominantly, the sustainability of the behaviour. Although only the second finding could be supported by statistical tests, the anecdotal observations and quantitative findings do point in the same direction. It was found that the sustainability concepts embedded in the game together with the gameplay dynamics drove the educational effects of the game. These game dynamics enable players to experience real sustainability issues: players are forced to reconsider their strategies, not necessarily to save the Island of Catan, but for their own victory in the game – which is a strong lesson related to sustainability in general and climate change specifically. Future research should focus on conducting larger-scale surveys supporting the execution of statistical tests. In addition, this research points at the untapped potential of teaching sustainability concepts through entertainment games and suggests that game developers incorporate sustainability concepts through educational mechanisms in their games. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Behavioural change; Climate change awareness; Education; Entertainment game; Serious gaming; Sustainability,Climate change; Education; Serious games; Statistical tests; Behavioural aspects; Behavioural changes; Change awareness; Entertainment game; Serious gaming; Sustainability education; Sustainability issues; Sustainable society; Sustainable development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019141120

Saving cost is a key motivation. This paper analyses the relation between inter-municipal cooperation and cost efficiency among Dutch municipal tax departments between 2005 and 2012. Motivated by the notion that cost savings are ascribed to scale economies, the relation between cooperation and cost is modelled explicitly through scale. The size of the cooperation is incorporated as a determinant of cost efficiency. The results indicate that inter-municipal cooperation can contribute to reducing cost and that the relation can be explained by scale. Municipalities or cooperations sized around 10,000 inhabitants are estimated up to 30% inefficient. At 60,000 inhabitants, the benefits of scaling are largely exhausted. Other than through scale, municipalities that cooperate are not estimated to operate significantly more or less efficient. © 2017 The Author(s).

In order to not only contribute to but also solve voltage problems, these inverters are increasingly asked to participate in intelligent grid controls. Communicating inverters implement distributed voltage droop controls. The impact of cyber-attacks to the stability of such distributed grid controls is poorly researched and therefore addressed in this article. We characterize the potential impact of several attack scenarios by employing the positivity and diagonal dominance properties. In particular, we discuss measurement falsification scenarios where the attacker corrupts voltage measurement data received by the voltage droop controllers. Analytical, control-theoretic methods for assessing the impact on system stability and voltage magnitude are presented and validated via simulation. © 2017",Cyber security; distribution network; risk assessment; stability; voltage control,Convergence of numerical methods; Crime; Distributed power generation; Electric inverters; Electric power distribution; Network security; System stability; Voltage control; Voltage distribution measurement; Cyber security; Diagonal dominance; Distributed grids; Distributed voltages; Intelligent grids; Low-voltage distributions; Potential impacts; Voltage magnitude; Risk assessment,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031804259

As opposed to previously proposed additive watermarking, we propose a multiplicative watermarking scheme, where each sensor's output is separately watermarked by being fed to a SISO watermark generator. Additionally, a set of equalizing filters is placed at the controller's side, which reconstructs the original output signals from the received watermarked data. We show that the proposed scheme has several advantages over existing approaches: it has no detrimental effects on the closed-loop performance in the absence of attacks; it can be designed in a modular fashion, independently of the design of the controller and anomaly detector; it facilitates the detection of replay attacks and the isolation of the time at which the replayed data was recorded. These properties are discussed in detail and the results are illustrated through a numerical example. © 2017",Channel equalisation; Control over networks; diagnosis; Fault detection,Diagnosis; Watermarking; Anomaly detector; Closed-loop performance; Control over networks; Equalisation; Multiplicative watermarking; Output signal; Sensor measurements; Watermark generators; Fault detection,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85031785751

The foundations of this model lie in the discourse surrounding RRI and selected maturity models from other domains as well as the results of extensive empirical investigation. The model was tested in three industry environments and insights from these case studies show the model to be viable and useful in corporate innovation processes.

Whereas learning from (changing) physical aspects is often part of the monitoring and evaluation phase within the ICM cycle, learning from the experiences of people is not structurally embedded in integrated coastal management. In this paper a method for learning from the experiences of different actors involved in the realisation of a pilot project is developed. The experiences of actors are expressed in personal narratives obtained in open interview settings. The narrative method developed in this paper, draws on methods deriving from narrative analysis and social science, and results in biographies that represent shared actor-based perceptions on the origin and evolution of a particular pilot project. Learning is then derived from analysis, interpretation and discussion of these biographies. The method is applied to a Dutch coastal pilot project, the Sand Engine. This massive, artificial, sandy peninsula, implemented in 2011, is designed to enhance coastal safety and forms a nature and recreation area. The narrative analysis of this case results in three biographies that contribute to understanding success experiences in this project, and the resonance of narrative-elements within the coastal policy community. © 2017 The Authors",Actor experiences; Case study; Coastal pilot projects; Governance; Narrative analysis,Coastal engineering; Actor experiences; Governance; Integrated coastal management; Learning-based approach; Monitoring and evaluations; Narrative analysis; Personal narratives; Pilot projects; Engines; analytical method; biography; coastal zone management; data interpretation; development project; governance approach; innovation; integrated approach; learning; monitoring; planning method; project assessment; project management; safety; Netherlands; South Holland,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017183575

Much has been written about automated vehicles and demand responsive transport. The combination of these potentially disruptive developments could reduce these problems. However, implementation is held back by uncertainties, including public acceptance, liability, and privacy. So, their potential to reduce urban transport problems may not be fully realized. We propose an adaptive approach to implementation that takes some actions right away and creates a framework for future actions that allows for adaptations over time as knowledge about performance and acceptance of the new system (called ‘automated taxis’) accumulates and critical events for implementation take place.

Four design attributes are proposed for this aim: (i) network cost recovery; (ii) deferral of network reinforcements; (iii) efficient consumer response; (iv) recognition of side-effects on consumers. Through an analytical hierarchy process (AHP), the evaluation methodology is applied to compare traditional cost allocation methods, on the basis of 100% energy, 100% demand, and 50% energy-50% demand, with more advanced pricing methods based on distribution locational marginal prices in combination with cost-reflective network charges. Numerical results are obtained through a case study based on the IEEE 34-node test feeder with DER integration.

The detection and prevention of cascading failures in power grids are important problems. Currently, grid operators mainly monitor the states (loading levels) of individual components in a power grid. The complex architecture of a power grid, with its many interdependencies, makes it difficult to aggregate the data provided by local components in a meaningful and timely manner. Indeed, monitoring the resilience of an operational power grid to cascading failures is a major challenge. This paper attempts to address this challenge. It presents a robustness metric based on the topology and operative state of a power grid to quantify the robustness of the grid. Also, it presents a distributed computation method with self-stabilizing properties that can be used for near real-time monitoring of grid robustness. The research thus provides insights into the resilience of a dynamic operational power grid to cascading failures during real-time in a manner that is both scalable and robust. Computations are pushed to the power grid network, making the results available at each node and enabling automated distributed control mechanisms to be implemented. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Cascading Failures; Distributed Computation; Power Grids; Real-Time Monitoring; Robustness,Closed loop control systems; Distributed computer systems; Electric fault currents; Electric power system control; Robustness (control systems); Cascading failures; Distributed computations; Distributed control mechanisms; Distributed monitoring; Near-real-time monitoring; Power grids; Real time monitoring; Stabilizing properties; Electric power transmission networks,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018666781

The government has therefore been urging the transformation of the industry by targeting 80% of all buildings to be green-certified by 2030. Thus far, Singapore has done relatively well, and is widely viewed as frontrunner in this respect. This paper addresses the question: what are the benefits and limitations of Singapore's sectoral innovation system in spurring an energy transition in the building sector, in particular by up-scaling the use of green building technology? The Sectoral Innovation Systems (SIS) theoretical framework was used to analyze the Singapore case. Four SIS components were assessed: technological regime, market demand, actor interactions and networks, and institutional framework. The benefits of Singapore's sectoral innovation system identified in the analysis basically concern aspects of all of the four elements of SIS. Particular success factors concerned the launching of an integrated strategy to support green building innovations (i.e., the Green Mark policy scheme), implementing support policies, and setting up test beds. Furthermore, a masterplan to engage and educate end-users was implemented, knowledge exchange platforms were set up, regulations on the use of efficient equipment in buildings were issued, and standards and a certification system were adopted. The results also shed light on key barriers, namely, the reluctance of building users to change their habits, ineffective stakeholder collaboration, and green buildings innovation support coming from the government only. Measures in place have been moderately effective. © 2017 by the authors.",Energy transition; Green buildings; Green certification; Policy; Sectoral innovation system; Singapore,building; certification; energy balance; energy policy; greenspace; innovation; knowledge; stakeholder; theoretical study; Singapore [Southeast Asia],Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85020018538

As cities already accommodate more than half of China's population, new challenges to urban food systems have emerged concurrently. Concerns over environmental degradation and food safety have provoked growing dissatisfaction with China's food regime. Amidst these concerns, the aim of this paper is to study the role of new and alternative approaches to food, focusing in on the question of how community supported agriculture (CSA) can deal with the food-related issues emerging from China's development. The paper adopts Granovetter's notions of social embeddedness to describe CSA's relational role in consumer-farmer dynamics, as well as the structural role within its broader relational context. Empirical data is drawn from surveys distributed among CSA farms, and interviews with key stakeholders in the Chinese CSA movement. The study finds that the model of CSA demonstrates an innovative approach to deal with food safety issues, address sustainability, and operate in an environment where future food demands are most critical. Although the movement's structural embeddedness is bound by several limitations and contradictions, it is argued that the CSA model offers important insights and adds value into ameliorating China's food systems. © 2017 by the authors.",Alternative food systems; China; Community supported agriculture; Embeddedness; Food safety,consumer-resource interaction; environmental degradation; food safety; food security; innovation; questionnaire survey; stakeholder; sustainable development; urban area; urbanization; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019877021

Private and public stakeholders in SUANs face difficulties in the implementation of technological and organisational design interventions due to the complex nature of the agricultural and urban environment. Current research on the dynamics of symbiotic networks, especially Industrial Symbiosis (IS), is based on historical data from practice, and provides only partly for an understanding of symbiotic networks as a sociotechnical complex adaptive system. By adding theory and methodology from Design Science, participatory methods, and by using agent-based modelling as a tool, prescriptive knowledge is developed in the form of grounded and tested design rules for SUANs. In this paper, we propose a conceptual Design Science method with the aim to develop an empirically validated participatory agent-based modelling strategy that guides sociotechnical design interventions in SUANs. In addition, we present a research agenda for further strategy, design intervention, and model development through case studies regarding SUANs. The research agenda complements the existing analytical work by adding a necessary Design Science approach, which contributes to bridging the gap between IS dynamics theory and practical complex design issues. © 2017 by the authors.",Design research; Industrial symbiosis dynamics; Network evolution; Participatory agent-based modelling; Symbiotic urban agriculture networks,design method; knowledge; network analysis; numerical model; stakeholder; urban agriculture; urban area; urban ecosystem,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85019944899

However, the current market penetration of EV is relatively low in spite of many governments implementing strong promotion policies. This paper presents a comprehensive review of studies on consumer preferences for EV, aiming to better inform policy-makers and give direction to further research. First, we compare the economic and psychological approach towards this topic, followed by a conceptual framework of EV preferences which is then implemented to organise our review. We also briefly review the modelling techniques applied in the selected studies. Estimates of consumer preferences for financial, technical, infrastructure and policy attributes are then reviewed. A categorisation of influential factors for consumer preferences into groups such as socio-economic variables, psychological factors, mobility condition, social influence, etc. is then made and their effects are elaborated. Finally, we discuss a research agenda to improve EV consumer preference studies and give recommendations for further research.

However, the robustness of business models (BM) is seldom tested vis-à-vis the fast and unpredictable changes in digital technologies, regulation and markets. The evaluation of the robustness of a BM raises several issues, such as how to describe the business model in a structured way, how to determine a relevant set of changes to test against, how to assess their impact on business model components, and how to use the results of the assessment to strengthen the business model. In this paper, we propose business model stress testing as a practical approach to evaluate the robustness of business model components. The method builds upon concepts from business model innovation and scenario planning. We illustrate our approach using a case example. Our approach enables testing individual business model components as well as the interrelation between components. The approach visualizes challenges and suggests ways to increase the robustness of BM. The stress testing approach is particularly useful in a stage of business model experimentation, i.e. if a company has to choose between alternative business models or still has to implement the business model. The underlying software tool is openly available for reuse and further development. The paper contributes to futures research literature by delivering the first method that allows to test the robustness of business models against future uncertainties. © 2017",Business model evaluation; Business model innovation; Business models; Scenario analysis; Scenario planning,business; innovation; modeling; stress,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018617249

Although, these vehicles are part of our cultural heritage with respect to road transport and mobility, they present (future) environmental concerns, which is a relevant development from policy perspective. Yet, as far as the authors are aware, there is hardly any academic literature addressing this issue. This study aims to provide a first exploration of historic cars and reasons for ownership and use and policy implications. To this end, a large explorative survey is conducted among HV owners of 15 European countries. Focusing on passenger car owners only, a latent class analysis is performed to identify possible segments among historic car owners. Seven latent classes are identified: recreational owners, reserved owners, repair men, die-hard fans, next generation fans, frequent drivers and collectors. Overall, the results indicate that there is large diversity in the ownership and use of historic cars and the reasons behind ownership. However, in general, historic cars are used much less than modern cars. Only the group of ‘frequent drivers’ (8% of the sample) represent a potential concern regarding emissions from a policy perspective.

Organizations, such as those used in real-life to structure human activities such as task allocation, coordination and supervision, can regulate the agents’ behavior space and describe the expected behavior of the agents. Assuming an open environment, where agents are developed independently of the Organizational structures, agents need to be able to reason about the structure, so that they can deliberate about their actions and act within the expected boundaries and work towards the objectives of the organization. In this paper, we present the AORTA reasoning framework and show how it can be integrated into typical BDI-agents.

In industrial practice and in academic work, risk ranking methods are commonly based an implicit risk conceptualization, adopting a particular foundational perspective and accounting for selected factors. Nevertheless, different stakeholders may adhere to various risk conceptualizations, applying different foundational perspectives and accounting for different factors in the ranking process. Identifying a gap in the literature to coherently consider these different foundations, this paper presents an approach for reconciling different foundational perspectives and stakeholder views, accounting for uncertainties about these. The approach is presented based on three foundational perspectives (the expected value, uncertainty and moral perspective), and developed as a Bayesian Network – Influence Diagram. The main use of the model is to make possible controversies in risk prioritization explicit, facilitating stakeholder deliberation. The model can easily be extended with new perspectives on risk ranking, or adapted based on additional knowledge about other aspects, e.g. relating to risk perception. The graphical representation allows insights into the contribution of various aspects, facilitating the selection of appropriate risk management actions. The developed model is applied to an example, suggesting that the envisaged benefits of the proposed approach are plausible. It is concluded that the novel approach has a clear potential for reconciling different foundational perspectives and stakeholder views on risk ranking. Nevertheless, it is stressed that the conceptual contribution made in this paper should be more elaborately tested in practical settings, substantiating the findings further. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Expected value; Foundational issues; Moral considerations; Risk ranking; Uncertainty,Bayesian networks; Decision making; Risk management; Expected values; Foundational issues; Moral considerations; Risk ranking; Uncertainty; Risk perception,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015799699

More specifically, we focus on the dynamics of anchoring as they can be observed in the Chinese context of eco-industrial development. We define anchoring as those activities that (typically local) actors perform to create local physical and institutional conditions conducive to the emergence and further development of industrial symbiosis in a specific regional industrial system. We argue that, in the study of industrial symbiosis dynamics, it is conceptually more useful to focus on anchoring as an activity, rather than anchor tenants as actors. Based on a systematic literature review, we distinguish two types of anchoring activities: institutional and physical. We analyze anchoring dynamics in the case of Qijiang Industrial Symbiosis (Chongqing Municipality) in China. We have identified the physical and institutional anchoring activities, the actors responsible for these activities, and how different anchoring activities build on each other over time. Our case study shows that the attempt to bring about industrial symbiosis in the Qijiang industrial park can be described in a richer way than just 'governmental planning'. © 2017 by the authors.",Anchoring; China; Dynamics; Industrial symbiosis,industrial development; industrial linkage; industrial practice; institutional framework; literature review; sustainability; China; Chongqing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017342705

To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first study worldwide which empirically investigates citizens' preferences for the spatial distribution of benefits accruing from a transport investment plan. We conducted two Stated Choice experiments: one involving an investment plan for travel time savings, the other involving an investment plan for traffic safety. Our results show that in the context of travel time savings, a vast majority of citizens has a strong preference for spatial equality. When the investment program involves traffic safety improvements, the share of citizens that has a preference for spatial equality is considerably smaller. Specifically, using a Latent class discrete choice analysis we identified distinct segments. The first segment has a very strong preference for the investment program having the largest total reduction in traffic deaths; the second segment assigns a substantial value to an equal distribution of reductions of traffic deaths across the Netherlands. Highly educated citizens are found to have a relatively strong preference for spatial equality as compared to low educated citizens. Contrary to our expectations, explanatory variables such as political orientation, income, car ownership and region of residence do not appear to associate with citizens' preferences for spatial equality. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,accident prevention; assessment method; decision making; investment; local participation; preference behavior; public transport; spatial analysis; transportation planning; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85017187567

Next to the academic debate on meaning and notions of resilience, the concept has been widely adopted and interpreted in policy contexts, particularly related to climate change and extreme weather events. In addition to having a positive connotation, resilience may cover aspects that are missed in common disaster risk management approaches. Although the precise definition of resilience may remain subject of discussion, the views on what is important to consider in the management of extreme weather events do not differ significantly.

This paper addresses those uncertainties. It presents an assessment framework for evaluating public organizations’ big data readiness. Doing so demystifies the concept of big data, as it is expressed in terms of specific and measureable organizational characteristics. The framework was tested by applying it to organizations in the Dutch public sector. The results suggest that organizations may be technically capable of using big data, but they will not significantly gain from these activities if the applications do not fit their organizations and main statutory tasks. The framework proved helpful in pointing out areas where public sector organizations could improve, providing guidance on how government can become more big data ready in the future. © 2016, The Author(s).",Assessment; Big data; Bold; E-government; Readiness; Use,Government data processing; Societies and institutions; Assessment; Bold; E-governments; Government organizations; Organizational characteristics; Public organizations; Public sector organization; Readiness; Big data,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84982126226

This way, the decision will not only be more accurate, but also be more defensible.

Factor analysis confirmed that the 11 indicators represent a societal acceptability of risks (SAR) concept. By using a scoring system we explain how an adjusted DF∗ can be determined. An illustrative example is also given to show how the model can actually be used.

In this paper, a data-intense analysis of economic city branding practices has been conducted in the Greater Pearl River Delta, taking into account national, provincial and municipal documents in socio-economic, urban and land use planning. Evidence of economic and ecological initiatives through branding at the level of symbolic urban projects, such as new towns, has also been examined. It transpires that Hong Kong, Macau, Guangzhou and Shenzhen have adopted more sophisticated economic brand identities than the others and the reflection of brand-related targets from their actual projects is also more credible.

This paper reports on an ethnographic study of one of its longest-running projects, Transition Town Lewes (TTL) in the United Kingdom. The aim of the study is to analyse TTL as a community. More specifically, we ask two questions: (1) what type of community is TTL? and (2) what are the challenges TTL faces as a community? With this, we contribute to the existing literature on local sustainability initiatives and in particular on Transition initiatives, by providing an in-depth understanding of the challenges and social dynamics at play in a day-to-day setting. We conducted three months of intensive ethnographic fieldwork using participant observation, interviews, and a focus group. Our analysis shows that TTL is a community that, on the one hand, is motivated by explicit intentions and goals, but that, on the other hand, leaves openness and flexibility regarding the level and specifics of participants' engagement. We introduce the novel concept of 'light intentional community' to describe this type of community. We first investigate intentionality in TTL, finding that differences exist between individual participant motivations and stated TTL objectives. We go on to describe the 'light' aspect of TTL-the differences in levels of engagement between community participants. Our analysis shows that TTL and its participants face two main challenges. First, TTL participants experience 'multi-dimensional liminality': they operate in a liminal space between mainstream society and TTL practices, and additionally experience a continuous sense of transitioning toward a moving goal. Second, TTL as a community faces internal and external frictions. These challenges are interrelated and stem from the structure and dynamics of TTL as a light intentional community. We conclude by reflecting on our analysis of the nature and challenges of 'light intentional communities', identifying what opportunities this concept brings for overcoming the challenges of grassroots globalization initiatives amidst mainstream society. © 2017 by the authors.

Assessing a supplier’s potential for improvement is very important when an organization wants to achieve certain environmental targets concerning their supply base, taking into account the limited resources available. In this paper, incorporating environmental evaluation criteria into a comprehensive supplier segmentation approach called ‘supplier potential matrix’ (SPM), a green supplier segmentation is proposed to segment the suppliers. Two overarching dimensions—supplier’s capabilities and supplier’s willingness—are used to evaluate the supplier’s green potential. The two dimensions are measured by multiple criteria. A sorting method called ELECTRE TRI-rC is used to solve the resulted multi-criteria decision-making problem. In order to make a more meaningful distinction, a simple method is also proposed to assess the suppliers with respect to the carbon footprint of the raw materials they supply. The results of this assessment are combined with the ones of the SPM, resulting in a more useful segmentation. The proposed model is applied to a sample containing the suppliers of a large international company. © 2017 The Author(s)",Corporate carbon footprint; ELECTRE TRI-rC; Green supply chain management; MCDM; Supplier evaluation; Supplier potential matrix (SPM); Supplier segmentation,,Article in Press,Article in Press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85014574329

However, the potential of this contribution is largely unknown. In this paper a generic agent-based model of servicising is presented with which this potential can be explored further, taking into account decision making procedures of business and consumer agents, including market research, preferences, and willingness to pay. The details of the servicising model are presented, and the model's abilities are demonstrated through three case studies from different sectors: car and bike sharing, crop protection, and domestic water-saving systems. Absolute decoupling was found to occur in some of the policy scenarios, but results vary widely between cases. It is concluded that the model can be used to explore the impact of public policy on the uptake of servicising and on absolute decoupling in various sectors, and is therefore a useful support tool for policy makers who aim to promote servicising, as well as for researchers studying potential servicising impacts. © 2017 The Authors",Absolute decoupling; Agent-based modelling; Behavioural economics; Policy exploration; Product-service systems; Servicizing,Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Decision making; Economics; Environmental impact; Water conservation; Absolute decoupling; Agent-based modelling; Decision making procedure; Market researches; Product-service systems; Production and consumption; Servicizing; Willingness to pay; Economic and social effects,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011709938

The use of adaptation pathways implies a systematic monitoring effort to inform future adaptation decisions. Such monitoring should feed into a long-term collaborative learning process between multiple actors at various levels. This raises questions about who should monitor what, when and for whom. We formulate an approach that helps to address these questions, developed around the conceptual core offered by adaptive policy pathways methods and their notion of signposts and triggers. This is embedded in a wider approach that revisits the critical assumptions in underlying basic policies, looks forward to future adaptation decisions, and incorporates reciprocity in the organization of monitoring and evaluation. The usefulness and practical feasibility of the approach is studied for a case of the Delta Programme in the Netherlands, which incorporated adaptation pathways in its planning approach called adaptive delta management. The case results suggest that our approach adds value to existing monitoring practices. They further show that different types of signposts exist. Technical signposts, in particular, need to be distinguished from political ones, and require different learning processes with different types of actors. © 2016",Adaptation; Adaptive delta management; Collaborative learning; Evaluation; Monitoring; Pathways,fresh water; adaptation; Article; climate change; collaborative learning; environment; human; learning; monitoring; Netherlands; planning; policy; priority journal; water supply,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007044399

On the basis of 4 cases of transboundary water governance, it will be shown how certain allocation principles are more likely to encourage cooperative action.

We employ a game-Theoretic setup to model the interaction between the sensors and the receiver. The cost function of the receiver is equal to the estimation error variance while the cost function of the sensor contains an extra term which is determined by its private information. We start by the single sensor case in which the receiver has access to a noisy but honest side information in addition to the message transmitted by a strategic sensor. We study both static and dynamic estimation problems. For both these problems, we characterize a family of equilibria in which the sensor and the receiver employ simple strategies. Interestingly, for the dynamic estimation problem, we find an equilibrium for which the strategic sensor uses a memory-less policy. We generalize the static estimation setup to multiple sensors with synchronous communication structure (i.e., all the sensors transmit their messages simultaneously). We prove the maybe surprising fact that, for the constructed equilibrium in affine strategies, the estimation quality degrades as the number of sensors increases. However, if the sensors are herding (i.e., copying each other policies), the quality of the receiver's estimation improves as the number of sensors increases. Finally, we consider the asynchronous communication structure (i.e., the sensors transmit their messages sequentially). © 1963-2012 IEEE.",Estimation; game theory; Kalman filtering; strategic sensors,Cost functions; Estimation; Asynchronous communication; Dynamic estimation; Estimation errors; Estimation quality; Kalman-filtering; Private information; Static estimation; Synchronous communications; Game theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011604863

In order to do so, several combinations of the two timetables are considered. The regularity is incorporated in their design and the flexibility is evaluated using the passenger satisfaction (in monetary units). Each of the tested timetables is constructed using the Passenger Centric Train Timetabling Problem (PCTTP), that is solved using a simulated annealing heuristic. Note that the PCTTP, unlike the traditional Train Timetabling Problem (TTP), does not take into account the conflicts among trains. The aim of the PCTTP is to design such timetables that the passengers’ satisfaction is maximized and it remains the aim of the TTP to remove any potential conflicts. The performance of each of the considered timetables is assessed on the real network of Israeli Railways. The results of the case study show that our proposed hybrid cyclic timetable can provide the benefits of the cyclic and the non-cyclic timetable simultaneously. This timetable consists of 75% of cyclic trains (securing the regularity of the service) and of 25% of non-cyclic trains (deployed as supplementary trains during the peak hours and capturing the demand fluctuation). The level of the passenger satisfaction of the hybrid cyclic timetable is similar to the level of the non-cyclic one, which has about 18.5% of improvement as compared to the purely cyclic one. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Cyclicity; Passenger centric train timetabling problem; Passenger satisfaction; Railway timetable; Simulated annealing,Railroads; Simulated annealing; Cyclicity; Demand fluctuations; Passenger satisfaction; Potential conflict; Railway timetables; Real networks; Train timetabling problem; Scheduling; cyclicity; demand analysis; design; heuristics; railway transport; regulatory framework; timescale; Israel,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007610457

In the last decade, GFP knowledge and policies have developed rapidly, but implementation has been less successful and has run into numerous barriers. In this paper, we address the challenge of realizing green flood protection goals by specifically considering knowledge in the decision-making of a Dutch flood protection project in Lake Markermeer. In this project, an ecological knowledge arrangement and a traditional flood protection knowledge arrangement are compared and their interactions analysed. The analysis provides insight into the specific difficulties of implementing GFP measures and identifies ways to realize GFP goals. The primary challenge is twofold: First, a self-reinforcing cycle of knowledge production and decision-making in the flood protection domain inhibits the introduction of innovative and multifunctional approaches such as GFP; second, the distribution of power is severely unbalanced in terms of ecological enhancement and flood protection, favouring the latter. Implementation of GFP requires structural change and the integration of ecological and flood protection knowledge and policy.

In this paper, we investigate (1) the influence of limited but dynamic intervention capacities and their effect on the effective reproduction number, and (2) the effects of proactive versus reactive intervention approaches. We use a transmission model extended with dynamical intervention capacities. Taking into account a bandwidth for potential over- and under-reporting in reported Ebola virus disease cases, the model is used to generate ensembles of plausible scenarios. Next, it is used for testing the effectiveness of more proactive approaches in extending intervention capacities across these scenarios. We show that reactive approaches in extending intervention capacities can lead to continued under-capacity, and, consequently, to an increase of the effective reproduction number and to accelerated EBOV transmission. Proactive approaches, which take deployment delays, doubling times of diseases, and potential under-reporting of the number of cases into account, help in limiting the total number of cases and deaths if the effective reproduction number in isolation is lower than the effective reproduction number outside of isolation. If the effective reproduction number in isolation is higher, proactive intervention policies still outperform reactive intervention policies. © 2016, © 2016 The Author(s).

The aim of our research is to understand how modularization interrelates with firm maturity when bundling business services, a topic that has been given limited attention in sourcing literature. Based on an exploratory research amongst 110 firms we found evidence for the relevance of influencing factors on firm maturity in bundling services. The findings provide evidence that the number of business services and the size of the firm correlate with the maturity of the firm. More specifically, our analysis identified that the type of market in which a firm acts (i.e. private or public) and adding the Marketing business function to a bundle does not increase firm maturity.

Meanwhile, various risk assessment methods have been developed that integrate safety and security, and these could help to address the corresponding threats by implementing suitable risk treatment plans. However, an overarching overview of these methods, systematizing the characteristics of such methods, is missing. In this paper, we conduct a systematic literature review, and identify 7 integrated safety and security risk assessment methods. We analyze these methods based on 5 different criteria, and identify key characteristics and applications. A key outcome is the distinction between sequential and non-sequential integration of safety and security, related to the order in which safety and security risks are assessed.

The methods to exchange data are evolving and becoming more and more advanced, supported by the rapid development of information and communication technology (ICT). Although some research has been carried out on the adoption of ICT-based information sharing, there is still very little understanding of enablers for information sharing arrangements between private and public organisations. Developing an information sharing arrangement often requires complex interactions among parties resulting in negotiated arrangements. This paper aims to derive factors of information sharing arrangements by assessing the importance of factors in shaping information sharing from public and private organisations perspectives. Factors found in previous studies were analysed using the Best-Worst method by collecting experts’ opinions. While private sector’s expert was much focussed on the Perceived Benefits, the public sector’s experts considered Trust, Investment, Perceived Costs and Relationship as the most important factors in shaping the information sharing arrangement between public and private organisations. Identifying which factors are crucial in shaping information sharing arrangements can help in reducing potential conflicts during planning, implementation and usage, and bringing benefits to all stakeholders. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2017.",Best worst method; Big data; E-Government; Information sharing; Information sharing arrangement; Interorganisational information system (IOS); Open data; System architecture; System governance,Big data; Electronic commerce; Government data processing; Information analysis; Smart city; Societies and institutions; Best worst method; E-governments; Information sharing; Interorganisational information systems; Open datum; System architectures; System governance; Information dissemination,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85034271980

The results show that the influence of household income, size, composition, gender, age, education, working status, and suburbanization levels on car ownership changed substantially between 1987 and 2014. The strong influence of household income on household car ownership diminished quite remarkably between 1987 and 2014, whereas the influence of household size grew significantly during the period.

Societal cyber risks require mitigation by all kinds of actors where government should take the lead due to its responsibility to protect its citizens. Since no formal global governance exists, the governmental responsibility should start at the national level of every country. To achieve successful management of global cyber risks, appropriate alignment between these sovereignly developed strategies is required, which concerns a complex challenge. To create alignment, getting insight into differences between national cyber strategies, is the first step. This, in turn, requires an appropriate analysis approach that helps to identify the key differences. In this article, we introduce such an analysis approach based on social contract theory. The resulting analysis model consists of both a direct and an indirect type of social cyber contract between governments, citizens and corporations, within and between sovereign nations. To show its effectiveness, the proposed social cyber contract model is validated through an illustrated case examining various constitutional rights to privacy, their embedding in the national cyber strategies and how their differences could cause potential barriers for alignment across sovereignties. © 2017, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",Cyber risk; Cyber security; National cyber strategy; National security; Privacy; Social contract,Alignment; Data privacy; Government data processing; Analysis approach; Analysis models; Cyber security; Global governance; National cyber strategy; Potential barriers; Social contract; Successful management; National security,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85029430683

Data collection involved in-depth interviews with fourteen key stakeholders. Data were analyzed using the qualitative data analysis software (ATLAS.ti). The results reveal that the governance context is only marginally supportive towards NZEB niche formation due to qualities of moderate extent, flexibility and intensity.

Yet most urban energy models only consider household load profiles, omitting the service sector. Realistic assessment of the potential for renewable resource integration in cities requires models that include detailed demand and generation profiles. Detailed generation profiles are available for many resources. Detailed demand profiles, however, are currently only available for households and not for the service sector. This paper addresses this gap. The paper (1) proposes a novel approach to devise synthetic service sector demand profiles based on a combination of a large number of different data sources, and (2) uses these profiles to study the impact of the service sector on the potential for renewable resource integration in urban energy systems, using the Netherlands as a case study. The importance of the service sector is addressed in a broad range of solar and wind generation scenarios, and in specific time and weather conditions (in a single scenario). Results show that including the service sector leads to statistically significantly better estimations of the potential of renewable resource integration in urban areas.

Design/methodology/approach: Following an empirical investigation among 244 respondents in India, the paper deploys path analysis via LISREL. The conceptual construction of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework is used to assess the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Multiple regression analysis informs the relationship of demographic variables with the behavioral intention to use and accept OGD. Findings: Path analysis showed that there is an increased use and acceptance of OGD among the respondents. Multiple regression analysis shows that men are more likely to use open data sets than women. Individual differences are found among the respondents with regard to OGD usage. Thus, while men may tap open data sets in line with their purposes and professional backgrounds, women are likely to tap the data sets even for non-professional purposes. Furthermore, the respondents who are younger in age are more behaviorally inclined to accepting and using OGD than their older counterparts. Practical implications: The Indian government needs to popularize and familiarize OGD initiatives among the people to a greater extent. The utilitarian value of OGD may be provided when data sets are more user-friendly, frequently updated and accurate. This would facilitate in better provision of public services besides appreciating the public sentiment. Further, with increased interaction between citizens and the government, public accountability and transparency may be better realized. Social implications: The study shows that different groups of people are engaging in tapping information through government websites and related portals. Societal influence was found to be an important factor which predicts the acceptance and usage of OGD. An infrastructure can help to enable the use of OGD. Originality/value: Hitherto, studies have focused on OGD initiatives in the developed countries, but extant literature is scarce on developing countries. Therefore, this study seeks to fill the literature gap by probing OGD use and acceptance among different stakeholder groups in India. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.",Acceptance; India; Open data; Open government data; UTAUT,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026914598

Although the economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability have been examined by many scholars and practitioners, thus far, the social dimension has been received less attention in literature and in practice, in particular in developing countries. Social sustainability enables other sustainability initiatives and overlooking this dimension can have a serious adverse impact across supply chains. To address this issue, this study proposes a framework for investigating the social sustainability of supply chains in manufacturing companies. To show the applicability and efficiency of the proposed framework, a sample of 38 experts was used to evaluate and prioritize social sustainability criteria, using a multi-criteria decision-making method called the ‘best worst method’ (BWM). The criteria are ranked according to their average weight obtained through BWM. The respondents view ‘contractual stakeholders influence’ as the most important social sustainability criterion. The results of this study help industry managers, decision-makers and practitioners decide where to focus their attention during the implementation stage, to increase social sustainability in their organizational supply chain and move towards sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Best worst method; BWM; Social sustainability; Sustainable supply chain management,Decision making; Developing countries; Supply chain management; Best worst method; Decision makers; Industry managers; Manufacturing companies; Multi-criteria decision making methods; Social dimensions; Social sustainability; Sustainable supply chains; Sustainable development; decision making; developing world; manufacturing; multicriteria analysis; stakeholder; supply chain management; sustainability; sustainable development; attention; decision making; female; human; human experiment; male; manager; physician; sustainable development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85026402741

A key idea shared among these is the use of models for exploratory rather than predictive purposes. Exploratory modeling aims at exploring the implications for decision making of the various presently irresolvable uncertainties. This is achieved by conducting series of computational experiments that cover how the various uncertainties might resolve. This paper presents an open source library supporting this. The Exploratory Modeling Workbench is implemented in Python. It is designed to (i) support the generation and execution of series of computational experiments; and (ii) support the visualization and analysis of the results from the computational experiments.

A well-formulated and implemented policy (mix) to spur adoption is said to be required to drive this process. This article presents an assessment of policies that aim to spur adoption among households, and the related governance system. The analytical framework used for this analysis is the Governance Assessment Tool (GAT). Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, and secondary quantitative data. The results show that policies in Nigeria had little effect in meeting pre-set goals. The governance system was found to be weakly developed due to a lack of policy, the overlapping work of different governmental organizations, a lack of appropriate resources, and a lack of householders' involvement in agenda-setting and decision-making processes. Current actions mostly depend on local programmes that run via donor aid. They include the free exchange of CFL bulbs and metering studies of end user energy consumption. The results add further insight in the fields of governance and policy on energy efficiency issues in developing countries.

In particular, a growing concern is present with respect to the intentional release of dangerous substances resulting in environmental and eco-terroristic attacks. Therefore, optimal selection and allocation of preventive security measures is becoming more important for decision-makers. Despite the existence of economic models supporting the decision-making process, their applications within the chemical industry security context are relatively limited. This study describes a specific model for economic analysis and selection of physical security measures, with respect to potential environmental and eco-terroristic attacks in chemical facilities. An example of application to a relevant case study is presented to show the model capabilities. Site-specific analysis of the baseline physical security system performance allows comparing the costs of different security upgrades with the benefits related to either prospective or retrospective losses, meanwhile accounting the uncertainties related to the threat probability. Selection of the most profitable security measures within budget constraints and definition of economic indicators are the main outputs of the model, in order to support decision-making processes for allocation of security barriers. © 2017 Institution of Chemical Engineers",Chemical industry; Environmental accident; Physical security measures; Security cost-benefit analysis; Security cost-effectiveness analysis; Security decision-making,Accidents; Budget control; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Chemical plants; Concrete pavements; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economics; Industrial economics; Terrorism; Uncertainty analysis; Cost effectiveness analysis; Dangerous substances; Decision making process; Environmental accidents; Industrial facilities; Physical security; Physical security systems; Security decision makings; Cost benefit analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85018448439

Due to potential mutual impacts among the tanks, severe domino accidents may occur after a tank catches fire. The emergency response to a tank fire may influence the development of the accident and impact the occurring of escalating events or so-called domino effects. In this paper, a fuzzy Petri-net (FPN) based reversed reasoning approach is proposed to analyze emergency response actions impacting domino effects. FPN is utilized to deduce the consequence-antecedent relationship between an accident and the emergency response actions. To analyze and compare the impacts of the actions on a domino effect, the backward reasoning is of special interest and often preferable when the occurrence probability of domino effects is known. As a tank fire accident in an oil depot usually lasts for a certain period of time, and as it may be greatly influenced by emergency response actions, it is taken as an example to illustrate the proposed approach. © 2017",Backward reasoning; Chemical process industry; Domino effect; Emergency response; Fuzzy Petri-net,Accidents; Chemical industry; Fires; Fuzzy systems; Petri nets; Tanks (containers); Backward reasoning; Chemical process industry; Domino effects; Emergency response; Fuzzy Petri nets; Emergency services,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85016066123

The effect of the institutional framework on the development of the biofuel sector is not yet well understood. This paper aims to analyze how biofuel production and production capacity could have evolved in Germany in the period 1992–2014. The effects of an agricultural policy intervention (liberalization of the agricultural market) and a bioenergy policy intervention (a tax on biodiesel after an initial exemption) are explored. Elements of the Modeling Agent systems based on Institutional Analysis (MAIA) framework, complex adaptive systems (CAS) theory, and Neo Institutional Economics (NIE) theory were used to conceptualize and formalize the system in an agent-based model. It was found that an early liberalization of the agricultural market led to an under-production of biodiesel; a late liberalization led to the collapse of biodiesel production. An early introduction of the biodiesel tax led to stagnation in biodiesel production and production capacity; a late introduction led to an increase in sunk costs provided that the biofuel quota is binding. Also, a lack of agents’ adaptation mechanism to forecast prices led to a decrease in patterns of biodiesel production when an external shock was introduced in the system. In sum, we argue that system behavior is influenced by individual behavior which is shaped by institutions. © 2017 The Authors",Agent-based modeling; Biodiesel supply chain; Complex adaptive systems; Path dependence; Policy analysis,Adaptive systems; Agriculture; Autonomous agents; Commerce; Computational methods; Costs; Supply chains; Agent-based model; Biodiesel supply chains; Complex adaptive systems; Path dependence; Policy analysis; Biodiesel; adaptive management; agricultural policy; agricultural production; bioenergy; biofuel; cost analysis; institutional framework; modeling; path analysis; policy analysis; power generation; renewable resource; supply chain management; Germany,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015786408

Although cybersecurity is one of the most important challenges faced by governments today, the visibility and public awareness remains limited. Almost everybody has heard of cybersecurity, however, the urgency and behaviour of persons do not reflect high level of awareness. The Internet is all too often considered as a safe environment for sharing information, transactions and controlling the physical world. Yet, cyberwars are already ongoing, and there is an urgent need to be better prepared. The inability to frame cybersecurity has resulted in a failure to develop suitable policies. In this paper, we discuss the challenges in framing policy on cybersecurity and offer strategies for better communicating cybersecurity. Communicating cybersecurity is confronted with paradoxes, which has resulted in society not taking appropriate measures to deal with the threats. The limited visibility, socio-technological complexity, ambiguous impact and the contested nature of fighting cybersecurity complicates policy-making. Framing using utopian or dystopian views might be counterproductive and result in neglecting evidence. Instead, we present evidence-based framing strategies which can help to increase societal and political awareness of cybersecurity and put the issues in perspective. © 2017 The Author(s)",communication; cyber war; cyberphysical society; cyberphysical system; cybersecurity; evidence-based policymaking; framing; information security; Internet of Things,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015714120

The structure of our review is based on the ripple effect concept, which represents the implications of automated vehicles at three different stages: first-order (traffic, travel cost, and travel choices), second-order (vehicle ownership and sharing, location choices and land use, and transport infrastructure), and third-order (energy consumption, air pollution, safety, social equity, economy, and public health). Our review shows that first-order impacts on road capacity, fuel efficiency, emissions, and accidents risk are expected to be beneficial. The magnitude of these benefits will likely increase with the level of automation and cooperation and with the penetration rate of these systems. The synergistic effects between vehicle automation, sharing, and electrification can multiply these benefits. However, studies confirm that automated vehicles can induce additional travel demand because of more and longer vehicle trips. Potential land use changes have not been included in these estimations about excessive travel demand. Other third-order benefits on safety, economy, public health and social equity still remain unclear. Therefore, the balance between the short-term benefits and long-term impacts of vehicle automation remains an open question. © 2017 Dimitris Milakis, Bart van Arem, and Bert vanWee.

This power transmission system performs two functions: interconnecting Northern European onshore power systems, and connecting offshore wind farms. Despite its benefits, the development of an integrated offshore grid combining the two functions is slow. The main reasons are the lack of cooperation and governance frameworks to overcome regional differences and distribute costs and benefits. These barriers were studied so far only qualitatively or through perfect foresight optimization models. We complement this by studying transmission expansion pathways of the grid, which are non-optimal and path dependent, using a novel and open-source simulation model for offshore transmission investments. Different expansion typologies are considered, which we find perform the grid functions with different levels of integration and transmission capacities. Besides these typology factors, modelling and simulation factors also affect the expansion selection. Typology, modelling and simulation factors interact to result in radically different offshore grid pathways, which exhibit strong path dependence. Thus, to avoid locking-out beneficial expansions for the Northern Seas offshore grid, planning should be regional and consider HVDC innovations. Then individual projects can be implemented based on their own merits. © 2017 The Authors",Northern Seas; Offshore grid; Offshore wind; Path dependence; Simulation; Transmission expansion planning,Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Expansion; HVDC power transmission; Offshore oil well production; Onshore wind farms; Transmissions; Northern Seas; Offshore grid; Offshore winds; Path dependence; Simulation; Transmission expansion planning; Offshore wind farms; energy market; governance approach; innovation; offshore application; optimization; simulation; smart grid; typology; wind farm; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015681845

In the wake of these partnerships, a great variety of cross-national and cross-city agreements were signed. Sino-European cooperation does not often run as smoothly as initially hoped because of diverging interests, cultural misunderstandings and practical limitations. In the background, a mismatch in normative conceptions Chinese and European participants have of 'good governance' plays a role. In this contribution, insights taken from Montesquieu's 'The Spirit of Laws' regarding checks and balances and trias politica (updated to 'sextas politica' for the 21st century) are used to comprehend how the exertion of power is distributed and expected to be distributed differently in Chinese than in European administrative traditions.

This article focuses on a thus far relatively understudied aspect of SSTEC, the financial vehicles used to fund SSTEC. The authors find that highly structured and intense collaboration at the national level between China and Singapore plays a catalytic role in attracting many other players to the project by giving them confidence that it is too big to fail. It encourages various preferential policies from lower governmental bodies, broad involvement of the private sector, a market-based operation model and the issuing of bonds in Singapore, which all contribute significantly to Tianjin eco-city's financial viability. The broad involvement of the private sector relieves part of the financial burden from local governments, while the bonds issued in international markets lower the interest rate for master developers. However, the Sino-Singaporean collaboration at the national level is far less likely to be replicated to other eco-cities, since this requires an enormous willingness on the part of other countries to invest manpower, money, and other resources into the construction of eco-cities in China. © 2017 by the author.",Bonds; China; Financial arrangements; Organizational arrangements; Tianjin Eco-City,development project; financial system; interest rate; local government; new town; organizational framework; private sector; urban development; urban planning; China; Singapore [Singapore (NTN)]; Singapore [Southeast Asia]; Tianjin,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013371900

To reduce the fluctuation, a more accurate real-time computation model, which considers the influence of the coil corners, is proposed in this paper. Three coordinate systems respectively for the stator, the mover, and the corner are established. The first harmonic of the magnetic flux density distribution of a Halbach magnet array is taken into account in this model. The coil is divided into the straight coil segment and the corner coil segment based on its structure. For the straight coil segment, the traditional Lorenz force method can be used to compute its electromagnetic force and torque, which is a function of the mover position. For the corner coil segment, however, the numerical calculation method can be used to get its respective electromagnetic force and torque. Based on the above separate analysis, an electromagnetic model can be derived, which is suitable for practical application. Compared with the well-known harmonic model, the proposed real-time computation model is found to have less model inaccuracy.

Methods for the quantification of flood risk are well established, but tend to deal with human and economic vulnerability as being static or changing with an exogenously defined trend. In this paper we present an Agent-Based Model (ABM) developed to simulate the dynamical evolution of flood risk and vulnerability, and facilitate an investigation of insurance mechanism in London. The ABM has been developed to firstly allow an analysis of the vulnerability of homeowners to surface water flooding, which is one of the greatest short-term climate risks in the UK with estimated annual costs of £1.3bn to £2.2bn. These costs have been estimated to increase by 60-220% over the next 50 years due to climate change and urbanisation. Vulnerability is influenced by home-owner’s decisions to move house and/or install measures to protect their properties from flooding. In particular, the ABM focuses on the role of flood insurance, simulating the current public-private partnership between the government and insurers in the UK, and the forthcoming re-insurance scheme Flood Re, designed as a roadmap to support the future affordability and availability of flood insurance. The ABM includes interaction between homeowners, sellers and buyers, an insurer, a local government and a developer. Detailed GIS and qualitative data of the London borough of Camden are used to represent an area at high risk of surface water flooding. The ABM highlights how future development can exacerbate current levels of surface water flood risk in Camden. Investment in flood protection measures are shown to be beneficial for reducing surface water flood risk.

Understanding the impact that smart metering systems may have on the electricity stakeholders (consumers, distribution system operators, energy suppliers and the society at large) is important for faster and effective deployment of such systems and of the innovative services they offer. For this purpose, in this paper an agent-based model is developed, where the electricity consumer behaviour due to different smart metering policies is simulated. Consumers are modelled as household agents having dynamic preferences on types of electricity contracts offered by the supplier. Development of preferences depends on personal values, memory and attitudes, as well as the degree of interaction in a social network structure. We are interested in exploring possible diffusion rates of smart metering enabled services under different policy interventions and the impact of this technological diffusion on individual and societal performance indicators. In four simulation experiments and three intervention policies we observe the diffusion of energy services and individual and societal performance indicators (electricity savings, CO2 emissions savings, social welfare, consumers’ comfort change), as well as consumers’ satisfaction. From these results and based on expert validation, we conclude that providing the consumer with more options does not necessarily lead to higher consumer’s satisfaction, or better societal performance. A good policy should be centred on effective ways to tackle consumers concerns. © 2017, University of Surrey.

The future perspective of active citizenship in the production of locally generated low-carbon energy is largely dependent on the existing institutional and policy frameworks and settings. Subnational governments, in particular, can have a prominent role in this process by engaging in institutional adaptation and policy innovation. The central research question of this paper is: In what ways do local and regional governments innovate in governing to respond to the emergence of LLCEIs? The research question is answered by comparing two case studies: the Dutch regions of Overijssel and Fryslân. We have conceptualized a meta-governing approach of experimentation, characterizing the innovations in governing that emerge when governments respond to the emergence of LLCEIs. We specifically focus on two capacities that subnational governments can use to enhance their governing capacity vis-à-vis LLCEIs and which substantiate the experimental meta-governance mode: institutional adaptation and policy innovation. We then formulated hypotheses that specify the expected policy innovations and institutional adaptations employed vis-à-vis LLCEIs. Data collection involved in-depth interviews and use of secondary data. The results show that a balancing process of authoritative and enabling modes of governing particularly characterized the type of policy innovations that were developed and the institutional adaptations that took place. Both provinces govern LLCEIs at arm's length and issue significant capacity-building strategies that vary in terms of their conditions. Municipalities, however, incline towards impromptu and opportunistic responses, some of them having lasting effects by patching up existing institutional settings, others having more of an episodic character. The results will further the understanding of subnational low-carbon policy and governance innovation processes vis-à-vis the role of LLCEIs. © 2017 by the authors.",Energy transition; Governance; Institutional adaptation; Local low-carbon energy initiatives; Low-carbon policy; Policy innovation; Subnational governments,adaptive management; citizenship; data management; energy efficiency; environmental planning; environmental policy; exploration; governance approach; innovation; institutional framework; policy analysis; Friesland; Netherlands; Overijssel,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85011032565

In this article we address the main institutional challenges that are caused by the integration of variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind energy in the European power system. We first address how the variable and unpredictable nature of wind and solar energy increases the demand for flexible resources and we discuss potential sources of flexibility. Next, we elaborate on how the need for more flexibility challenges the prevailing market design of todays liberalized power systems. Furthermore, we discuss the key areas where there is a need for a more integrated approach to research and policy making. The need for a more integrated approach is motivated by exposing a number of critical interdependencies between technical and institutional sub-systems. © 2016 The Authors",Electricity markets; Flexibility; Institutions; System integration,Commerce; Integrated control; Natural resources; Power markets; Societies and institutions; Solar energy; Wind power; Electricity sector; Flexibility; Flexible resources; Integrated approach; Integration of renewable energies; Solar and wind energies; System integration; Variable renewable energies; Solar power generation,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85008172908

Traditional approaches focus on the technical problems only. Little attention has been paid to the institutional analysis of biofuel supply chains. This paper aims to extend the analysis of the effect of institutions on the emergence of biofuel supply chains by developing a conceptual framework that combines elements of complex adaptive systems, (neo) institutional economics and socio-technical systems theory. These elements were formalized into an agent-based model. The proposed method is illustrated by a case study on a biodiesel supply chain in Germany. It was found that the patterns in production capacity result from investors basing their decisions on optimistic perceptions of the market development that increase with a favorable institutional framework. Conversely, patterns in biodiesel production cannot be completely explained by this mechanism. The proposed framework assisted the model conceptualization phase and allowed the incorporation of social structures into the agent-based model. This approach could be developed further to provide insights on the effect of different future deployment strategies on bioenergy systems emergence and development. © 2016 The Authors",(Neo) institutional economics; Agent-based modeling; Biofuel supply chains; Complex adaptive systems; Socio-technical systems,Adaptive systems; Autonomous agents; Biodiesel; Computational methods; Economics; Societies and institutions; Supply chains; Agent-based model; Biofuel supply chains; Complex adaptive systems; Institutional economics; Sociotechnical systems; Biofuels; bioenergy; biofuel; conceptual framework; economic analysis; industrial development; market development; supply chain management; Germany,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84998787305

Not only the extent of climate change and the extent and nature of its impacts are unknown, also socio-economic conditions may change in unpredictable ways, as well as social preferences. Often, it is not possible to find solid ground for estimating probabilities for the relevant range of imaginable possible future developments. Yet, some of these may have profound impacts and consequences for society which could be reduced by timely proactive adaptation. In response to these and similar challenges, various approaches, methods and techniques have been proposed and are being developed to specifically address long-term strategy development under so-called deep uncertainty. This paper, first, offers a brief overview of developments in the field of planning under (deep) uncertainty. Next, we illustrate application of three different approaches to fresh water provision planning under uncertainty in case studies in the Netherlands: a resilience approach, oriented to (re) designing fresh water systems in such a way that they will be less vulnerable, resp. will be able to recover easily from future disturbances; a robustness approach, oriented to quantitative assessment of system performance for various system configurations (adaptation options) under a range of external disturbances, and an exploratory modeling approach, developed to explore policy effectiveness and system operation under a very wide set of assumptions about future conditions. © 2015, The Author(s).",Adaptation; Fresh water supply; Resilience; Robustness; Uncertainties,Climate change; Robustness (control systems); Water; Adaptation; Planning under uncertainty; Proactive adaptations; Quantitative assessments; Resilience; Socio-economic conditions; System configurations; Uncertainties; Water supply; adaptive management; freshwater; future prospect; policy analysis; uncertainty analysis; water management; water planning; water supply; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951856906

We also present a call to enhance the dialogue and foster the actions of governments, the international scientific community, research funding agencies and additional stakeholders in order to develop effective solutions to support water resources systems adaptation. Finally, we call the scientific community to a renewed and unified effort to deliver an innovative message to stakeholders.

We used a private datafeed of Asprox-infected websites to issue notifications from three senders with different reputations: an individual, a university and an established anti-malware organization. Results: We find that our detailed abuse reports significantly increase cleanup rates. Surprisingly, we find no evidence that sender reputation improves cleanup. We do see that the evasiveness of the attacker in hiding compromise can substantially hamper cleanup efforts.

Due to the importance of such projects, researchers have considered different ways to evaluate the success, with a focus on the outputs of these projects. However, what has been neglected is the other side of the coin—the inputs. The main aim of this study is to incorporate both the inputs and outputs of these projects into a more meaningful measure called efficiency. A ratio of the weighted sum of outputs over the weighted sum of inputs identifies the efficiency of a Ph.D. project. The weights of the inputs and outputs can be identified using a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method. Data on inputs and outputs are collected from 51 Ph.D. candidates who graduated from Eindhoven University of Technology. The weights are identified using a new MCDM method called Best Worst Method (BWM). Because there may be differences in the opinion of Ph.D. candidates and supervisors on weighing the inputs and outputs, data for BWM are collected from both groups. It is interesting to see that there are differences in the level of efficiency from the two perspectives, because of the weight differences. Moreover, a comparison between the efficiency scores of these projects and their success scores reveals differences that may have significant implications.

The impact is quantified based on a cluster integer unit commitment model which renders it suitable for modeling large-scale power systems with a high computational performance. The results show that, first, the inter-regional transmission grid capacity expansion has obvious economic benefit in reducing the total variable generation costs, mainly due to the increased ability of transmitting coal power with low marginal generation costs and the reduction in non-served load. Second, the expansion has a very limited impact on reducing the curtailment of renewable generation by 2030, although the extent to which the expansion can mitigate the curtailment of renewable generation increases with the share of renewable power in the generation portfolio. Third, the expansion increases CO2 emissions of the power supply in 2030 by around 2%, mainly because it facilitates more use of cheap yet low-efficiency coal generation in regions with low fuel prices. To better deliver the value of the inter-regional grid expansion for China's power decarbonization, this paper proposes that: (1) the planning of the inter-regional and intra-regional grid development should be coordinated with the renewable power development; and (2) effective dispatch mechanisms which account for CO2 emissions or generation efficiency across regions should be established. Additionally, the government plan of the inter-regional transmission capacity in 2030 is basically sufficient in enabling bulk power delivery and promoting renewable generation across regions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",China; Decarbonization; Impact; Inter-regional transmission grid; Unit commitment,Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decarbonization; Electric power system economics; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Expansion; China; Computational performance; Generation portfolios; Impact; Large-scale power systems; Transmission capacities; Transmission grids; Unit-commitment; Electric power system interconnection; carbon emission; chemical reaction; economic analysis; energy planning; expansion; governance approach; optimization; power generation; renewable resource; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988310663

We assess the adequacy of market strategies available to private actors developing offshore wind farms in Europe, by employing the development and diffusion pattern model. The model includes two earlier phases in addition to the large-scale deployment phase of other diffusion models: the innovation and the market adaptation phases. During its development and diffusion offshore wind moved from experimentation to a dominant design (monopile foundations and a permanent magnet generator). Simultaneously, wind farms shifted from an experimental to a commercial purpose and grew from 10 to 316 MW on average. The turbine and wind farm development markets kept a high concentration throughout all phases. Also, the wind farm life cycle and supply chain became more integrated and drew less from the onshore wind and oil & gas sectors. This development and diffusion was shaped by the barriers of cost, project risk and complexity, capital requirements, and multi-disciplinarity. Wind farms developers combined three niche strategies to address these barriers: the subsidized, the geographic, and the demo, experiment and develop. The barriers make these niche strategies more adequate than strategies of mass-market (dominating a market) or wait-and-see (developing resources but waiting for uncertainty reduction before market entrance). Nonetheless, the barriers and market strategies changed during the development and diffusion pattern. Thus, cost and risk reductions decreased the importance of the subsidized niche, while the geographic niche becomes less important as offshore wind develops outside of Europe. The study also identified an increase in cooperation for wind farm development, as development became more international and with more frequent alliances. Wind farm developers and development and diffusion models research must consider how contemporary forms of cooperation improve or hinder the market strategies. © 2016 The Authors",Barriers; Cooperation; Development and diffusion; Innovation; Market strategies; Offshore wind,Commerce; Diffusion; Diffusion barriers; Electric utilities; Gas industry; Innovation; Life cycle; Onshore wind farms; Permanent magnets; Planning; Supply chains; Wind power; Barriers; Cooperation; Generation technologies; Large-scale deployment; Market strategies; Offshore winds; Permanent magnet generator; Wind farm development; Offshore wind farms,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981517853

We start filling a gap in the literature by showing how the philosophical analysis of the nature of healthcare activities can contribute to (care) robot ethics. We rely on the nature-of-activities approach recently proposed in the debate on human enhancement, and we apply it to the ethics of care robots. The nature-of-activities approach will help us to understand why certain practice-oriented activities in healthcare should arguably be left to humans, but certain (predominantly) goal-directed activities in healthcare can be fulfilled (sometimes even more ethically) with the assistance of a robot. In relation to the latter, we aim to show that even though all healthcare activities can be considered as practice-oriented, when we understand the activity in terms of different legitimate ‘fine-grained’ descriptions, the same activities or at least certain components of them can be seen as clearly goal-directed. Insofar as it allows us to ethically assess specific functionalities of specific robots to be deployed in well-defined circumstances, we hold the nature-of-activities approach to be particularly helpful also from a design perspective, i.e. to realize the Value Sensitive Design approach. © 2015, The Author(s).",Care Centered Value Sensitive Design; Care robot ethics; Nature-of-activities approach; Robot ethics; Value Sensitive Design,ethics; health care delivery; human; robotics; standards; trends; Delivery of Health Care; Humans; Robotics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84946780565

This research investigated implicit levels of SA of train traffic controllers (TTCs) in order to contribute to the body of knowledge on rail human factors research and SA. A novel approach was used to uncover levels of implicit SA through a set of three analyses: (1) fairly low SAGAT values with correlations between SAGAT scores and multiple performance indicators; (2) negative correlations between work experience and SAGAT scores; and (3) structurally lower level-1 SA (perception) scores in comparison to level-2 SA (comprehension) scores in accordance with Endsley's three-level model. Two studies were conducted: A pilot study – which focused on SA measurements with TTCs in a monitoring mode (N = 9) – and the main study, which involved TTCs from another control center (N = 20) and three different disrupted conditions. In the pilot study, SA was measured through the situation-awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT), perceived SA and observed SA, and performance was measured through punctuality and unplanned stops of trains before red signals. In the main study, SA was measured through SAGAT, and perceived SA and multiple performance indicators, such as arrival and departure punctuality and platform consistency, were assessed. In both studies, the set of three analyses showed consistent and persistent indications of the presence of implicit SA. Endsley's three-level model and related SAGAT method can be constrained by the presence of these intuitive, unconscious processes and inconsistent findings on correlations between SAGAT scores and performance. These findings provide insights into the SA of TTCs in the Netherlands and can support the development of training programs and/or the design of a new traffic management system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Decision-making; Dynamic environment; Intuition; Situation awareness; Socio-technical system; Tacit knowledge,Decision making; Human computer interaction; Dynamic environments; Intuition; Situation awareness; Sociotechnical systems; Tacit knowledge; Benchmarking,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994820097

We use two exploratory simulation models to investigate the consequences of the combination of both complexity and uncertainty in relation to the global energy system and state stability. Our simulations show that shale developments could be seen as part of a long term hog-cycle, with a short term drop in oil prices if unconventional supply substitutes demand for oil. These lower oil prices may lead to instability in rentier states neighbouring the EU, especially when dependence on oil and gas income is high, youth bulges are present, or buffers like sovereign wealth funds are too limited to bridge the negative economic effects of temporary low oil prices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Energy mix; Energy prices; Exploratory modelling; Shale revolution; State stability; System Dynamics,Costs; Shale; Stability; System stability; Energy mix; Energy prices; Extraction capacity; Political stability; Primary energy source; Sovereign wealth funds; State stability; System Dynamics; Shale oil; energy market; energy resource; geopolitics; oil production; price dynamics; shale gas; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986880428

The use of resources plays an important role in the successful implementation of emergency response, but there may be conflicts in the use of resources for emergency actions. According to the emergency response in case of an oil fire, two types of emergency response models with dynamic structure are established by using Resource-Oriented Timed Colored Hybrid Petri-Net (RO-TCHPN). Type 1 model does not establish a special conflict avoidance mechanism for emergency actions, while Type 2 model uses a queuing method to avoid possible conflicts in the use of limited resources by multiple actions. In this paper, the two types of models are simulated and analyzed, including (1) emergency response process simulation, which analyzes and determines the time and the conditions of the potential conflicts occurring; and (2) comparison analysis, analyzing the improvement of the Type 2 model as compared with the Type 1 model. Increasing emergency resources to reduce or avoid conflicts and whether all the fire-trucks should be fully filled at the beginning of an emergency response, are also discussed based on the simulation. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",Emergency resources; Emergency response actions; Petri nets; Simulation analysis,Petri nets; Comparison analysis; Conflict avoidance; Dynamic structure; Emergency resources; Emergency response; Hybrid Petri net; Potential conflict; Simulation analysis; Emergency services,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84983526983

In the 1990s, risk-based approaches were developed to bring safety into design as well as economic considerations. In the 2000s, the inherent safety approach began to be practiced on a limited basis, and process safety evolution made significant progress. As process systems continue to become more complex and operations move into remote and harsh environments, traditional risk analysis may no longer be sufficient. Dynamic risk assessment is the basis for the next generation of risk and management approaches that help to enable safer complex process systems operating in extreme environments. This article investigates the main contributions in the area of dynamic risk assessment. Then, an overall framework for dynamic risk management of process facilities is proposed. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Complex Processes; Dynamic risk assessments; Economic considerations; Extreme environment; Harsh environment; Inherent safety; Process safety management; Risk based approaches; Risk management,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979785031

Currently, the focus in flood risk management is being adapted again, in view of increasing societal vulnerability and foreseeable effects of climate change. In this context, the choice between making more room for the river and/or strengthening embankments is again of major concern. This calls for further quantification of the effectiveness, costs and benefits of all possible measures. Making room for rivers was originally advocated by referring to a reduction of the probability of failure of the embankments and a reduction of the consequences in case of breaching. These arguments still apply, but the effect of making more room for rivers on flood risk has never been properly quantified yet. In this paper we identify three potential risk reducing effects, and quantify their effect for along the Rhine and Meuse Rivers in the Netherlands. We show that lowering the flood levels means smaller flood probabilities, that larger floodplain surface area significantly influences the relationship between discharge and flood level, and that lower flood levels in the river translate into smaller flooding depths and/or flood extent, and thus reduce the consequences of flooding. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013678109

In the context of climate change and socio-economic development, future flood risk will inevitably rise; adaptive measures, for instance upgrading of sea dikes and floodwalls, improving drainage systems and implementing green infrastructures, are proposed under the changing environment in the cities. A question of when to implement what measures in the cities over time is then brought up. The approach of dynamic adaptive policy pathways is applied to formulate adaptation pathways for a case study of Shanghai to explore the optimal investment strategy in context of deep uncertainties. Adaptation concept is not only aiming to achieve optimal strategy but also to determine when to implement the measures. The adaptation pathways for three types of floods (coastal flood, river flood and pluvial flood) in Shanghai were formulated through a preliminary qualitative analysis. This could provide an insight to the long-term feasibility of adaptive flood risk strategies.

This translates in 'anticipatory standards' which need to be met in 2050, and which apply for the then foreseen climate and economy. Whilst the government maintains to have adopted a policy of adaptive planning and management, the new standards are thus based on one future situation, which qualifies as a 'high end scenario' from a flood risk management perspective. The consequences of adopting these new standards are now becoming clear. It is expected that many hundreds of kilometres of primary flood defences need to be reinforced and/or raised, at an estimated investment of about 9-14 billion euros. The many uncertainties about actual future development, however, complicate the decision making about the implementation of individual reinforcement projects: should one aim at immediately meeting the new standard or gradually improve and grow towards it? In this paper we discuss the uncertain decision making context, show that lawfulness (working according to procedures, rules and regulations) and expediency (towards a purpose) may jeopardize the good intentions of adaptive management, and argue that optimization may not provide the most useful answer to this decision making problem. © 2016 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85013653105

Recently, attention has begun to focus on the perceived shortcomings in the practical delivery of related initiatives, with several publications suggesting a gap between ambitious policy goals and the emerging realities of the newly built environment. To probe this further, in this article we examine – based on the policy network approach – how the gap between high-level national policies and local practice implementation can be explained in the current Chinese context. We develop a four-pronged typology of eco city projects based on differential involvement of key (policy) actor groups, followed by a mapping of what are salient policy network relations among these actors in each type. Our analysis suggests that, within the overall framework of national policy, a core axis in the network relations is that between local government and land developers. In some cases, central government agencies – often with buy-in from international architecture, engineering and consulting firms – seek to influence local government planning through various incentives aimed at rendering sustainability a serious consideration. However, this is mostly done in a top-down manner, which overemphasizes a rational, technocratic planning mode while underemphasizing interrelationships among actors. This makes the emergence of a substantial implementation gap in eco city practice an almost predictable outcome.

Different developments have caused stagnation of further improvement: The variation on the benchmarked performance indicators has decreased, participation in the benchmark became mandatory for all Dutch drinking water supply organizations, it lacks a focus on the future, and participating organizations experience high financial pressure. These developments decrease the influence of the drivers. Four possible new impulses for the benchmark are identified and their influence on the effect of the drivers is analysed. The two most promising new impulses are tomake the benchmark adaptive and to involve consumers in the process of benchmarking, both have a positive influence on the effect of almost all drivers. This study contributes to the understanding of how benchmarking leads to improvement and to the analysis of the impact of design choices, leading to well-founded decisions for re-design of the Dutch drinking water benchmark.",Adaptive benchmark; Benchmarking; Consumer involvement; Drinking water supply; The Netherlands,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84992176512

More recently, they appear to be challenged to go even beyond that mission and adopt more interactive relationships with user groups and society. A shift like this calls for a solid study on how well the knowledge commercialization has performed at university in recent years. Focussing on a European country, the Netherlands, this paper provides a characterization of that performance and the underlying factors, and in particular the boundary-spanning capacity of university teams. In an analysis of trends in commercialization, involving almost 370 university-driven technology projects, we observe that 22% of all older projects succeed in market access within ten years after start of the project. For younger ones, this is 15% of all projects within 5 years after start. To clarify these possibly low levels, a rough-set analysis of about 40 technology projects is carried out, pointing to the years of collaboration with a large firm/user organization and an efficient use of resources as positive influences on commercialization, while affinity among project managers with the market also tends to be a key factor. Despite a general trend of more permeable university-industry boundaries, it deserves recommendation to further increase boundary-spanning activities, among other things through co-creation labs. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Boundary-spanning; Co-creation; Collaboration; Commercialization; Technology projects; The Netherlands; Universities,Commerce; Boundary spanning; Co-creation; Collaboration; Commercialization; Netherlands; Technology projects; Universities; Engineering education; commercialization; knowledge; performance assessment; project management; resource use; technological development; university sector; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84988322192

We analyse 34 cases of smart grid innovation projects based on extensive archival data as well as interviews. We find that projects relying on relational governance are more likely to provide incentives for collaboration. Especially non-financial incentives such as reputational benefits and shared intellectual property rights are more likely to be found in projects relying on relational governance.

Scenario discovery relies on the use of statistical machine learning algorithms. The most frequently used algorithm is the Patient Rule Induction Method (PRIM). This algorithm identifies regions in an uncertain model input space that are highly predictive of model outcomes that are of interest. To identify these regions, PRIM uses a hill-climbing optimization procedure. This suggests that PRIM can suffer from the usual defects of hill climbing optimization algorithms, including local optima, plateaus, and ridges and valleys. In case of PRIM, these problems are even more pronounced when dealing with heterogeneously typed data. Drawing inspiration from machine learning research on random forests, we present an improved version of PRIM. This improved version is based on the idea of performing multiple PRIM analyses based on randomly selected features and combining these results using a bagging technique. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated using three cases. Each of the cases has been published before and used PRIM. We compare the results found using PRIM with the results found using the improved version of PRIM. We find that the improved version is more robust to new data, can better cope with heterogeneously typed data, and is less prone to overfitting. © 2016 The Authors",Deep uncertainty; Exploratory modeling; Robust decision making; Scenario discovery,Algorithms; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision trees; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Uncertainty analysis; Deep uncertainties; Hill-climbing optimization; Machine learning research; Model based approach; Robust decisions; Rule Induction Methods; Scenario discovery; Statistical machine learning; Optimization; algorithm; decision making; machine learning; modeling; optimization; scenario analysis; uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978394264

Among the cities aiming at sustainable development, resource-based cities (RBCs) are of special concern due to the tight interrelations economy, urban development, natural resources and environmental context have in them. Excessive exploitation and inefficient resource utilization often cause pollution and ecological risks. As natural resources are getting exhausted, their resource-based industries will collapse, threaten wider urban development and lead to economic recession. In this article, we focus on the economic and ecological dilemmas that the RBCs face in China. We first present an overview of China's policy implementation for rescuing and transforming RBCs. Then a particular RBC, Yichun, which is classified as “recessionary”, is analyzed to understand the challenges that it faces during its transition. The method of eco-efficiency is used to uncover Yichun's environmental performance in relation to its economic development. Subsequently, we explore the barriers in terms of industrial transformation, conflicts between national, provincial and local governmental actions, and the effects of the circular economy in Yichun. At the end of this article, we formulate several recommendations to facilitate Yichun's sustainable development. We propose that Yichun specifically needs to consider the energy consumption and pollution when selecting alternative industries. Furthermore, one-size-fits-all policies do not help to solve the problems in Yichun. Policies need to be contextualized locally through well-reflected coordination between higher and lower tiers of government. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd",China; Eco-efficiency; Forestry city; Resource-based city; Sustainable development,Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental protection; Natural resources; Planning; Pollution; Sustainable development; Urban growth; China; Eco-efficiency; Environmental contexts; Environmental performance; Industrial transformations; Policy implementations; Resource-based city; Sustainable consumption; Industrial economics,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951807967

Inspired by Wilkinson’s work in 2012, this article proposes a new quantitative spatial vulnerability model for network systems, which emphasizes the spreading impact of spatially localized hazards on these systems. This model considers hazard location and area covered by a hazard, and spatially spreading impact of the hazard (including direct impact and indirect impact through network topology) and proposes an absolute spatial vulnerability index and a relative spatial vulnerability index to reflect the vulnerability of a network system to local hazards. The model is then applied to study the spatial vulnerability of the Chinese civil aviation network system. The simulation results show that (1) the proposed model is effective and useful to study spatial vulnerability of civil aviation network systems as the results well explain the general situation of the Chinese civil aviation system; and (2) the Chinese civil aviation network system is highly vulnerable to local hazards when indirect impacts through network connections are considered. © 2016, The Author(s).",Civil aviation; Network system; Spatially localized hazards; Vulnerability,air transportation; computer simulation; hazard assessment; natural hazard; numerical model; quantitative analysis; transportation infrastructure; transportation system; vulnerability; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84989315918

However, many scholars have argued that such travel choice decisions of individuals in their role of consumer of mobility are likely to be a poor proxy of how they in their role of citizen believe government should spend tax money to generate travel time gains for large numbers of travelers. So far, this possible deviation between what we call ‘consumer VoT’ and ‘citizen VoT’ has not been studied empirically. In this paper, we fill this gap, by designing a Stated Choice experiment with eight different frames; some representing a typical consumer choice situation, others gradually approaching a citizen perspective. We find that individuals’ willingness to pay from previously collected tax money for travel time gains created by a government policy, is significantly higher than their willingness to pay, from their after tax income, for time gains obtained by choosing a different route. This result implies that citizen VoT is higher than consumer VoT. This difference does not stem from a stronger willingness to spend previously collected tax money compared to spending one's own income, but from a difference in the value attached to travel gains: a travel time gain resulting from government action is valued more than the same travel time gain obtained by one's own route choices. This and a range of other empirical results are discussed in depth, in light of the conceptual differences between preferences of individuals in a role of consumer or citizen. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd",,Budget control; Economics; Taxation; Consumer choice; Empirical approach; Government actions; Personal travel; Stated choice experiments; Travel costs; Value of time; Willingness to pay; Travel time; perception; preference behavior; travel behavior; travel time; willingness to pay,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84978829354

UBI is especially relevant for younger drivers, who are a high-risk population. The effectiveness of UBI should be enhanced by providing in-car feedback optimised for individual drivers. Thirty young novice drivers were therefore invited to complete six experimental drives with an in-car interface that provided real-time information on rewards gained, their driving behaviour and the speed limit. Reward size was either displayed directly in euro, indirectly as a relatively large amount of credits, or as a percentage of the maximum available bonus. Also, interfaces were investigated that provided partial information to reduce the potential for driver distraction. Compared to a control no-UBI condition, behaviour improved similarly across interfaces, suggesting that interface personalisation after an initial familiarisation period could be feasible without compromising feedback effectiveness. Practitioner Summary: User experiences and effects on driving behaviour of six in-car interfaces were compared. The interface provided information on driving behaviour and rewards in a UBI setting. Results suggest that some personalisation of interfaces may be an option after an initial familiarisation period as driving behaviour improved similarly across interfaces. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",behavioural feedback; driver distraction; Intelligent speed advisor; intelligent transport system; Pay-As-You-Drive,"Intelligent systems; Traffic control; Driver distractions; Driving simulator study; Feedback strategies; In-car interfaces; Intelligent speed advisor; Intelligent transport systems; Partial information; Real-time information; Feedback; age; car driving; comparative study; computer simulation; feedback system; female; health insurance; human; male; prevention and control; procedures; psychology; reinforcement; risk reduction; safety; simulation training; traffic accident; young adult; Accidents, Traffic; Age Factors; Automobile Driving; Computer Simulation; Feedback; Female; Humans; Insurance, Accident; Male; Risk Reduction Behavior; Safety; Simulation Training; Token Economy; Young Adult",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84967224355

Yet the impact of international research interactions (IRIs) on national innovation performance is ambiguous. In this study patent-based bibliometric indicators are developed to investigate the influence of different types of IRI on innovation performance using bibliometric data covering eight knowledge intensive manufacturing sectors and 32 countries during the 2003–2008 period. This sector-based approach avoids some of the problems of using patents as innovation indicators, like varying patenting propensities across sectors by comparing the same sectors across countries. In the study a knowledge production function is estimated for each sector, with patents serving as an indicator of knowledge output. The overall results suggest an absence of positive influence of IRI on innovation performance, and sometimes even a negative influence pointing to ‘reversed knowledge flows’. But the pattern is nuanced and differs per sector and type of collaboration. For example, interpersonal collaboration has a negative or no effect on innovation performance depending on the sector, and institutional collaboration has no effect on innovation performance. Within MNC collaboration has a positive influence on innovation performance in the chemicals and pharmaceuticals sectors, but a negative effect or no effect in other sectors. Computers are an exceptional sector in that the influence of IRI depends on the absolute size of the sector in the domestic economy. The paper concludes with the theoretical relevance of these findings and some policy implications are also discussed. © 2015 Elsevier Inc.",Bibliometric; Innovation; International; Patents; Research interaction,Economics; Innovation; Public policy; Bibliometric; Institutional collaboration; International; International researches; Knowledge production function; Multinational corporations; Patents; Technological complexity; Patents and inventions; globalization; innovation; manufacturing; performance assessment; research,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951781955

One or maybe the major epistemic virtue of successful models is their capacity to adequately represent specific phenomena or target systems. According to similarity views of scientific representation, models should be similar to their corresponding targets in order to represent them. In this paper, Suárez’s arguments against similarity views of representation will be scrutinized. The upshot is that the intuition that scientific representation involves similarity is not refuted by the arguments. The arguments do not make the case for the strong claim that similarity between vehicles and targets is neither necessary nor sufficient for scientific representation. Especially, one claim that a similarity view wants to uphold, still, is the following thesis: only if a vehicle is similar to a target in relevant respects and to a specific degree of similarity then the vehicle is a scientific representation of that target. © 2015, The Author(s).",Isomorphism; Models; Scientific representation; Similarity,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84937687438

Small and medium-sized cities (SMCs) deserve scholarly attention as well. The main question is: What factors influence climate change policy and local climate actions in SMCs? In this article we present an analytical framework to analyze climate change policy and local climate actions of SMCs. The framework addresses different aspects: policy-input, -throughput, -output, -outcome, characteristics of the local environment, local action arenas, influence by higher government levels, and interaction with climate change issue networks. The framework is used to analyze and compare four case studies of SMCs in the Dutch region of Twente (two urban and two rural municipalities, and addresses both adaptation and mitigation). Results show that both 'localist', 'multi-level' and issue network membership factors influence local climate policy action. Governance modes discerned concern mostly 'governing by authority' and 'self-governing'. When reflecting on the role of SMCs in climate action the study revealed the importance of local capacity building schemes issued by provincial government, inter-municipal network collaboration, and the potential for local governments to mobilize and organize citizen action. © 2016 by the authors.",Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Climate governance; Energy transition; Small and medium-sized cities,analytical framework; climate change; comparative study; environmental planning; environmental policy; governance approach; local government; mitigation; rural planning; small town; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84990990329

Using scenario discovery and worst-case discovery, we assess the implications of various uncertain factors on the competitive position of the port of Rotterdam. It is found that overall the competitive position of Rotterdam is quite robust with respect to the various uncertain factors. The main vulnerability is the quality of the hinterland connections.

Specifically, we investigate how to better deliver the value of EVs by improving designs in the power system and charging strategies, given expected developments by 2030 in both the power system and EV penetration levels. The impact of EV charging is quantified by applying an integrated transportation-power system model on a set of scenarios which represent uncertainties in charging strategies. We find that deploying EVs essentially shifts the use of gasoline to coal-fired power generation in China, thus leading to more coal consumption and CO2 emissions of the power system. Economically, EVs outperform gasoline-powered vehicles in terms of average fueling costs. However, the impact of EVs in terms of CO2 emissions at the national level largely depends on the charging strategy. Specifically, controlled charging results in more CO2 emissions associated with EVs than uncontrolled charging, as it tends to feed EVs with electricity produced by cheap yet low-efficiency coal power plants located in regions where coal prices are low. Still, compared with uncontrolled charging, controlled charging shows absolute advantages in: (1) mitigating the peak load arising from EV charging; (2) facilitating RES generation; and (3) reducing generation costs and EV charging costs. Hence, in light of this trade-off of controlled charging with the goals of energy security, economic efficiency and reducing environmental impacts, policy interventions in the Chinese power system should opt for controlled charging strategies in order to best realize the benefits of EVs. Accordingly, this paper proposes that increasing the use of cleaner forms of electricity generation, such as RES power and gas power, and establishing energy efficiency and CO2 emission regulations in power dispatch are critical for China. Lastly, this work illustrates what the optimized charging profiles from the power system perspective look like for different regions. These results can inform Chinese policy makers in creating a better integration of the transportation and the power system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Charging; China; Electric vehicles; Energy-economic-environmental implications; Power system,Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Charging (furnace); Coal; Costs; Crashworthiness; Economic and social effects; Electric load dispatching; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Environmental impact; Gasoline; Public policy; Vehicles; China; Coal-fired power generation; Electric vehicle charging; Electricity generation; Environmental implications; Integrated transportations; Power system; Uncontrolled charging; Electric power system economics; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electric vehicle; emission control; energy planning; energy use; environmental impact; environmental policy; trade-off; China,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84963745998

This review develops a simple and effective methodology that can be applied to other reviews of energy systems models. It jointly considers the studies of interest, the system characteristics, a categorization framework and relevant indicators. The analysis indicates most studies focus on investment and operation of the grid using optimization models, with rare use of other research questions or other model approaches. Moreover, results vary significantly, and their comparability is limited due to differences in assumptions, methodology and detail of results publication.

Using data from the literature, the research objective is a better understanding of the influences of innovation on the organization of the supply chain. A methodology is developed to model the supply chain before and after the emergence of the innovation. The evolution inside and outside of the company following the strategic choices, are observed. In this way, the impact of the innovation on the supply chain can be detailed. The results of this study show scenarios to design a new supply chain after the emergence of an innovation.

The preferred framework of analysis was Aristotle’s theory of friendship: it was argued that online friendships face many obstacles that hinder them from ever reaching the highest form of Aristotelian friendship. In this article I aim to offer a different perspective by critically analyzing the arguments these philosophers use against online friendship. I begin by isolating the most common arguments these philosophers use against online friendship and proceed to debunk them one by one by pointing out inconsistencies and fallacies in their arguments and, where needed, offering empirical findings from media and communication studies that offer a more nuanced view on online friendships. I conclude my analysis by questioning the correctness of the application of the Aristotelian theory of friendship by the critics of online friendship: in my view, the critics are applying the Aristotelian theory to online friendships in a rather narrow and limited way. Finally, I conclude my thesis by proposing that in the rapidly changing online landscape, a one-size-fits-all application of the Aristotelian theory on friendship is not sufficient to accurately judge the multitude of relationships that can exist online and that the various positive and valuable elements of online friendships should also be acknowledged and analyzed. © 2016, The Author(s).",Aristotle; Friendship; Internet; Online friendship; Social media; Social networking sites; Virtual friendship; Virtue ethics,Internet; Social networking (online); Aristotle; Friendship; Online friendship; Social media; Social networking sites; Virtual friendship; Virtue ethics; Philosophical aspects,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84955300454

Genetically modified seeds have the special characteristic of being living artefacts that can reproduce and spread; thus it is difficult to control where they end up. In addition, genetically modified seeds may also bring about uncertainties for environmental and human health. Where they will go and what effect they will have is therefore very hard to predict: this creates a puzzle for regulators. In this paper, I use the problem of contamination to complicate my ascription of forward-looking moral responsibility to owners of genetically modified organisms. Indeed, how can owners act responsibly if they cannot know that contamination has occurred? Also, because contamination creates new and unintended ownership, it challenges the ascription of forward-looking moral responsibility based on ownership. From a broader perspective, the question this paper aims to answer is as follows: how can we ascribe forward-looking moral responsibility when the effects of the technologies in question are difficult to know or unknown? To solve this problem, I look at the epistemic conditions for moral responsibility and connect them to the normative notion of the social experiment. Indeed, examining conditions for morally responsible experimentation helps to define a range of actions and to establish the related epistemic virtues that owners should develop in order to act responsibly where genetically modified organisms are concerned. © 2016, The Author(s).",Contamination; Epistemic virtues; Genetically modified organisms; Moral responsibility; Social experimentation,"agriculture; ethics; social responsibility; technology; transgenic organism; wind; Agriculture; Organisms, Genetically Modified; Social Responsibility; Technology; Wind",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84953261307

To be able to appropriately respond to such a situation, the nuclear energy technology in question should be reversible, i.e. it must be possible to stop its further development and implementation in society, and it must be possible to undo its undesirable consequences. This paper explores these two conditions by applying them to geological disposal of high-level radioactive waste (GD). Despite the fact that considerations of reversibility and retrievability have received increased attention in GD, the analysis in this paper concludes that GD cannot be considered reversible. Firstly, it would be difficult to stop its further development and implementation, since its historical development has led to a point where GD is significantly locked-in. Secondly, the strategy it employs for undoing undesirable consequences is less-than-ideal: it relies on containment of severely radiotoxic waste rather than attempting to eliminate this waste or its radioactivity. And while it may currently be technologically impossible to turn high-level waste into benign substances, GD’s containment strategy makes it difficult to eliminate this waste’s radioactivity when the possibility would arise. In all, GD should be critically reconsidered if the inclusion of reversibility considerations in radioactive waste management has indeed become as important as is sometimes claimed. © 2015, The Author(s).",Geological disposal; Lock-in; Retrievability; Reversibility; Social experiment,ethics; nuclear energy; radioactive waste; waste management; Nuclear Energy; Radioactive Waste; Waste Management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941340549

I will argue that they are not, at least not in the sense in which the notion of experiment is being used in the natural and social sciences. If the introduction of a new technology in society is interpreted as an experiment, then we are dealing with a notion of experiment that differs in an important respect from the notion of experiment as used in the natural and social sciences. This difference shows itself most prominently when the functioning of the new technological system is not only dependent on technological hardware but also on social ‘software’, that is, on social institutions such as appropriate laws, and actions of operators of the new technological system. In those cases we are not dealing with ‘simply’ the introduction of a new technology, but with the introduction of a new socio-technical system. I will argue that if the introduction of a new socio-technical system is considered to be an experiment, then the relation between the experimenter and the system on which the experiment is performed differs significantly from the relation in traditional experiments in the natural and social sciences. In the latter experiments it is assumed that the experimenter is not part of the experimental system and is able to intervene in and control the experimental system from the outside. With regard to the introduction of new socio-technical systems the idea that there is an experimenter outside the socio-technical system who intervenes in and controls that system becomes problematic. From that perspective we are dealing with a different kind of experiment. © 2015, The Author(s).",Control; Experiments; Natural sciences; Social sciences; Socio-technical systems; Technological innovations,ethics; research; science; sociology; standards; technology; Research; Science; Social Sciences; Technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84923238631

Depending on the interpretation, group norms may be intended to affect the group as a whole, each member of a group, or some members of the group. Moreover, upholding group norms may require coordination among the members of the group. We have identified three sets of agents affected by group norms, namely, (i) the addressees of the norm, (ii) those that will act on it, and (iii) those that are responsible for ensuring norm compliance. We present a formalism to represent these, connecting it to a minimalist agent organisation model.

The RV method has become more and more popular recently, and has been found to lead to very different estimation results than conventional RU models. Previous studies have reported these differences but did not explain them, which limited the confidence in the RV model as a useful foundation for transport policy analysis. In this paper, we first analytically show in what way exactly the two models are different and why they may generate different estimation results. Based on this deeper understanding of the connection and difference between the two models, we formulate hypotheses regarding the conditions under which differences in estimation results are expected to be smaller or larger. Using synthetic data, we empirically test these expectations. Results provide strong support for our hypotheses, allowing us to derive a number of practical recommendations for analysts interested in using the RV and RU models in their VTTC-analysis. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Random utility; Random valuation; Value of time; Value of travel time changes,computer simulation; hypothesis testing; model test; numerical model; planning theory; theoretical study; travel time,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84960856102

PRIM identifies regions in the model input space that are highly predictive of producing model outcomes that are of interest.

PRIM struggles when confronted with cases where the uncertain factors are a mix of data types, and can be used only for binary classifications. We compare two more lenient objective functions which both address the first problem, and an alternative objective function using Gini impurity which addresses the second problem. We assess the efficacy of the modification using previously published cases. Both modifications are effective.

However, despite the significant role that smart cities can play to deal with recent urban challenges, the concept has been being criticized for not being able to realize its potential and for being a vendor hype. This paper reviews different conceptualization, benchmarks and evaluations of the smart city concept. Eight different classes of smart city conceptualization models have been discovered, which structure the unified conceptualization model and concern smart city facilities (i.e., energy, water, IoT etc.), services (i.e., health, education etc.), governance, planning and management, architecture, data and people. Benchmarking though is still ambiguous and different perspectives are followed by the researchers that measure -and recently monitor- various factors, which somehow exceed typical technological or urban characteristics. This can be attributed to the broadness of the smart city concept.

Since the end of the 1950s, natural gas exploration and exploitation has been a major focus of the Dutch energy policy. Discussions about the future of energy in the Netherlands tend to focus either on pro-gas or pro-renewable energy. Using Q methodology we have constructed more nuanced perspectives on the future of energy in the Netherlands. We used these perspectives in a stakeholder dialogue, in which the participants further detailed the perspectives and discussed future policy options. Analysis of the outcomes of this process teaches us that the Netherlands remain gas-focused, that renewable energy sources are as much a dogma as nuclear power was in the 1960s, and that the prospect of an austere future is a non-debatable issue. From a methodological perspective it can be concluded that the refined methodology contributed to diversity in views, opened up the dominant discourse and led to learning among participating stakeholders. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Constructive conflict methodology; Energy futures; Explorative scenarios; Q methodology; Stakeholder dialogue; The Netherlands,alternative energy; conflict management; energy policy; future prospect; natural gas; renewable resource; stakeholder; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84961784056

Despite their popularity and wide application, they have recently become the object of discussion and research in scientific environments, which can be seen as part of a wider focus on foundational issues in the risk analysis discipline. Identifying several serious limitations and problems with the risk matrix approach, various authors have proposed extensions, modifications and recommendations for their use. One issue which has been raised recently but has attracted relatively limited scientific attention is the consideration of uncertainty in risk diagrams, i.e. how to visually represent and communicate uncertainty. This paper first reviews the available proposals for this question. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals are discussed. Finally, some new proposals are made on how to represent uncertainty in risk diagrams in practical applications. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Risk analysis; Risk communication; Risk diagram; Risk matrix; Strength of knowledge; Uncertainty,Graphic methods; Risk analysis; Risk management; Uncertainty analysis; Risk communication; Risk matrix; Strength of knowledge; Uncertainty; Risk assessment; human; mathematical computing; mathematical parameters; parameters; prediction; priority journal; probability consequence diagram; probability consequence diagram with Tukey box plot and strength of evidence assessment; probability consequence diagram with uncertainty interval strength of evidence assessment and assessment of assumption deviation risk; process development; quantitative analysis; Review; risk assessment; risk diagram; risk factor; risk management; uncertainty,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949939164

It is possible that major fires occur at the same time due to terrorism or vandalism (i.e. a security point of view). These fires might lead to domino effects at different locations around. Whether the fire emergency response preparedness, which is organized to fight against one of the fires, can handle the multiple fires, is studied in this article and a Petri-net based simulation approach is proposed. Through Petri-net based simulation, the process of fire-fighting can be revealed. A model of fighting against three fires is established, and the strategies of fire fighters staffing arrangements are analyzed. The results show that in most cases the distribution according to fire severity is better than the average distribution, but in some conditions the average distribution strategy prevails. Different backup staffing strategies are also compared, and the results indicate that the improvement by increasing staffing backups also depends on the fire conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.",Counter-terrorism emergency; Emergency response strategy; Simulation analysis; Simultaneous fires,Emergency services; Fire extinguishers; Fire fighting equipment; Flammable materials; Industrial chemicals; Personnel selection; Petri nets; Terrorism; Counter terrorism; Distribution strategies; Emergency response; Hazardous chemicals; Large scale fires; Simulation analysis; Simulation approach; Staffing strategies; Fires,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84958552615

This approach has been used in many areas, including modeling of route choice, vehicle ownership, trip destination, residential location, and activity scheduling. The need for sampling of alternatives is accentuated for random regret minimization (RRM) models because, unlike random utility models, the regret function for each alternative depends on all of the alternatives in the choice-set. In this paper we develop and test a method to achieve consistency, asymptotic normality, and relative efficiency of the estimators while sampling alternatives in a class of models that includes RRM. The proposed method can be seen as an extension of the approach used to address sampling of alternatives in multivariate extreme value models. We illustrate the methodology using Monte Carlo experimentation and a case study with real data. Experiments show that the proposed method is practical, performs better than a truncated model, and results in finite-sample estimates that provide a good approximation of those obtained with a model considering all of the alternatives. ©2016 INFORMS.",Large choice-sets; Random regret minimization; Sampling of alternatives,Transportation; Asymptotic normality; Computational burden; Discrete choice models; Large choice-sets; Multivariate extremes; Random regret minimizations; Random utility model; Residential locations; Sampling,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84957682184

VTT can be differentiated in many dimensions (e.g., travel purpose, travel mode). This study scrutinized the extent to which VTT was differentiated or not differentiated for empirical-theoretical, political-philosophical, or practical reasons in the appraisal practices of the United Kingdom, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands, and Denmark. Each country's appraisal guidelines were analyzed, and 32 experts in CBA were interviewed. It was found that the five countries made different decisions on differentiation of VTT with respect to the dimensions of mode, journey length, and trip purpose. Moreover, it was found that the VTT was not segmented between regions in the five countries. The appraisal guidelines in the countries underpinned this decision with the argument that politicians would reject CBA if the VTT varied between regions, and most of the experts consulted in this study endorsed this view. Empirical evidence in the literature was scant, however, either to support or contest the argument that politicians would not accept regional differentiation. Thus 19 Dutch politicians were asked to reflect on the desirability of a VTT differentiated by region. It was found that most politicians supported this differentiation. Politicians, among others, stated that the purity and impartiality of CBA should be safeguarded. This result called into question the assumption articulated in the guidelines that politicians would reject CBA if the VTT were differentiated between regions. © 2016, National Research Council.

In contrast to the potential, in a recent survey more than half of financial service organizations reported that big data has not delivered the expected value. One of the main reasons for this is related to data quality. The objective of this research is to identify the antecedents of big data quality in financial institutions. This will help to understand how data quality from big data analysis can be improved. For this, a literature review was performed and data was collected using three case studies, followed by content analysis. The overall findings indicate that there are no fundamentally new data quality issues in big data projects. Nevertheless, the complexity of the issues is higher, which makes it harder to assess and attain data quality in big data projects compared to the traditional projects. Ten antecedents of big data quality were identified encompassing data, technology, people, process and procedure, organization, and external aspects. © 2016 IEEE.",antecedents; big data; big data quality; data quality; finance,Data reduction; Finance; Quality control; Societies and institutions; antecedents; Content analysis; Data quality; Empirical examination; Expected values; Financial institution; Financial service; Literature reviews; Big data,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85015211893

Among other things, the choice of university supervisor plays a pivotal role. Success is more likely if there is joint decision-making by both university and partner. We believe our findings help universities and firms to collaborate successfully. © The Author 2016. Published by Oxford University Press.

The approach is based on choicebased conjoint analysis in which heterogeneity is captured by means of latent-class analysis. The research is novel in several respects. First, it addresses the diverse valuation of service preferences by shippers who use rail transport. Second, besides estimates for rail users who contract for transport services, the analysis also arrives at new estimates for forwarders as immediate clients for rail services. Third, in addition to the conventional random utility maximization (RUM) model, the paper discusses trials with a random regret minimization (RRM) model and a hybrid RUM-RRM model.

Although local energy initiatives, such as ICESs are rapidly emerging due to community objectives, such as cost and emission reductions as well as resiliency, assessment and evaluation are still lacking on the value that these systems can provide both to the local communities as well as to the whole energy system. In this paper, we present a model-based framework to assess the value of ICESs for the local communities. The distributed energy resources-consumer adoption model (DER-CAM) based ICES model is used to assess the value of an ICES in the Netherlands. For the considered community size and local conditions, grid-connected ICESs are already beneficial to the alternative of solely being supplied from the grid both in terms of total energy costs and CO2emissions, whereas grid-defected systems, although performing very well in terms of CO2emission reduction, are still rather expensive. © 2016 by the authors.",Distributed energy resources (DERs); Energy communities; Multi-carrier energy systems; Optimization; Smart grids,Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy resources; Optimization; Distributed Energy Resources; Emission reduction; Local energy systems; Modern development; Multi carrier; Performance assessment; Simultaneous integration; Smart grid; Smart power grids,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85009810473

Disruptions in the power distribution grid are responsible for a significant fraction of electric power unavailability to customers. The impact of extreme weather conditions, continuously increasing demand, and the over-ageing of assets in the grid, deteriorates the safety of electric power delivery. Measures to analyse the robustness characteristics and to identify vulnerabilities of power grids are of utmost importance. This paper proposes a metric to quantitatively assess the robustness of power distribution grids from a topological point of view.

To improve the acceleration speed of a motor, this paper proposes the moving-coil maglev planar motor with a concentric winding structure. The coordinate system has been built for the multiple degrees of freedom movement system. The Lorenz force method has been applied to solve its electromagnetic model. The real-time solving of the generalized inverse matrix of factors can realize the decoupling of the winding current. When the maglev height changes, the electromagnetic force and torque decreases exponentially with the increase of the air gap. To decrease the influence on control system performance by the internal model change and the external disturbance, this paper proposes an improved active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) to design the controller. This new controller overcomes the jitter phenomenon due to the turning point for the traditional ADRC, thus it is more suitable for the maglev control system. The comparison between ADRC and the improved ADRC has been conducted, the result of which shows the improved ADRC has greater robustness. © 2016 by the authors.",Concentric winding; Improved ADRC; Maglev planar motor; Robustness,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85007470954

We used observations, questionnaires, and interviews to study how the 700+ audience were facilitated to experientially learn about the show’s main themes: compassion and collaboration. This case study contributed to our understanding how performance art may improve games for learning and training purposes, many of which now are notoriously ‘boring’. We concluded that performance art’s main contribution, in particular to games discussing fundamental values such as compassion, is to captivate players and ‘lure’ them into their natural behaviour. Thus the Parsifal game opera emotionally confronted its audience with their – callous and selfish – behaviour and intensified their learning through embodied experiences. However, some players lacked time and support to (collectively) reflect on their experiences and lacked catharsis. Therefore, we recommend using gameful performance art for learning and training purposes, provided that all activities in experiential learning are sufficiently facilitated. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.",Experiential learning; Game-based learning; Informal learning; Interactive drama; Performance arts; Professional training; Real-life games,Personnel training; Experiential learning; Game-based Learning; Informal learning; Interactive drama; Performance arts; Professional training; Real-life games; Surveys,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85005976236

Some domains, such as the digital content -based businesses, are enjoying (almost) full ICT utilization whereas other domains, assuming physical and/or societal and/or ""intuitive"" inputs, are much less successful in terms of digitization. Voting using digital technology (or ""eVoting"" for short) is in between those domains since: (i) the mere process of voting is a very good ""candidate"" for digitization but at the same time (ii) the ""surrounding"" societal aspects are often difficult to ""frame"" as Internet-based services. (i) can be seen from the ""voting through computer"" observed in several European countries while (ii) can be seen from the lack (to date) of technology-enabled systems completely supporting the voting process and its related aspects. Further, the conceptualization and implementation of any voting system is to originate from legislation - This makes the goal of resolving (i) + (ii) even more challenging. Hence, to benefit from ICT, the question remains what should be done and how it should be done. The step from legislation to requirements and implementations taking into account socio-technical aspects, is crucial for the successful realization of eVoting. Despite its relevance, this has been given hardly sufficient attention in literature. This void is addressed by the current position paper; the contribution of the paper is two-fold: we firstly propose a general technology-independent conceptual model on voting and on this basis, we propose requirements for (partially) digitizing this process. Requirements are dependent on the societal context and therefore we opted for focusing on one particular EU country where the transition to eVoting is currently under discussion. We have planned as future research to reflect the identified requirements into architectures and implementations, and to get experts' feedback on this.",Architecture; Conceptual model; Evoting; Requirements,Architecture; Electronic voting; Information services; Software design; Systems engineering; Conceptual model; Digital technologies; European Countries; Information and Communication Technologies; Internet-based services; Requirements; Socio-technical aspects; Technology independent; Service oriented architecture (SOA),Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85003848906

The 1997/98 El-Niño floods affected 1.5 million persons and led to an estimated USD 1.2 billion infrastructural damage, USD 236 million agricultural damage and USD 9 million on other losses (property, soil erosion, pollution). Recent rains in October 2015 to January 2016 left 112 Kenyans dead and over 100,000 internally displaced. The Kenyan Government predictions indicate that the number of affected persons will be approximately 1,500,000, before 2018. Despite the numerous exposures to floods, Kenyan communities' resilience to floods risks is weak. Traditional crisis management approaches have not been successful in enhancing citizen capacity in flood prevention and preparedness. In addition, the past flood forecasts have not played a key role, as early warning advisories. To address these complexities, we propose a location-based game so as to create a positive learning environment and increase territory awareness, collaboration and soft skills, which are necessary for flood preparedness. Moreover, through playing the game, we hope that social learning for joint action will be enhanced. The game is known as ""MAFURIKO"" which is a Swahili word for floods. Through MAFURIKO, the citizens may learn basic flood prevention and preparedness procedures, may begin to see their predicament differently and may also identify opportunities which remain untapped. In this paper, we outline a theoretical framework and preliminary MAFURIKO game design specifications for the Nzoia sub-basin of the Lake Victoria Basin, in Kenya. MAFURIKO is intended to enhance the capacity of Kenyan citizens on flood risk reduction, so that they can work with the Kenyan Government to prevent and prepare for future floods. Future work will entail completion, staging and application of the location based game. © 2016 The Authors.",Citizen Participation; Climate-change; Deep Uncertainty; Flood Preparedness; Kenya; Lake Victoria Basin; Location-based Games; Natural Disasters; Nzoia Basin; Serious Gaming; Water Management,Climate change; Computer aided instruction; Disasters; Flood control; Lakes; Location; Nickel; Rain; Water management; Citizen participation; Deep uncertainties; Kenya; Lake Victoria; Location based games; Natural disasters; Nzoia Basin; Serious gaming; Floods,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994008666

The paper explores whether participatory scenario construction in the form of stories coupled with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2100 projections may contribute to increased utility of the scenarios and projections for climate-induced risk reduction, in the Nile Basin. The Nile River is 6,695 kilometres long and covers a basin area of 3.18 million square kilometres (one-tenth of the African land mass). The basin is highly susceptible to climate-change induced disasters. According to the IPCC, there is high confidence that the Basin will suffer from severe shifts in biome distribution, compounded water stress, degradation of marine life and reduced crop productivity. There is also medium confidence that the Nile Basin will experience: severe decline in livestock, significant increase in vector and water-borne diseases, undernutrition, increased migration and sea level rise. The basin is already experiencing some of these key risks, on the other hand, their impact in the next 30 to 35 years is deeply uncertain. The findings of this paper are based on four scenarios, namely: Kazuri, Miskeen, Umoja and EjoHeza and data collected from two forums that were held in Jinja, Uganda and Nairobi, Kenya. The forum participants were a multi-disciplinary team of national and international stakeholders. The paper concludes that coupling Nile Basin storylines with the IPCC 2100 projections, proved to be an effective tool in increasing the utility of the scenarios and projections, for purposes of disaster risk reduction. Future work will entail analysing the uptake of the scenarios to resolve deadlocks and enhance cooperation. © 2016 The Authors.",Adaptation; Climate Change; Decision Support; Deep Uncertainty; Disaster; Futures; Nile; Risk Reduction; Risk Transfer; Scenarios; Water Management,Agriculture; Decision making; Decision support systems; Disasters; Risk perception; Sea level; Water management; Adaptation; Decision supports; Deep uncertainties; Futures; Nile; Risk reductions; Risk transfer; Scenarios; Climate change,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84994000513

The decisions are made in the context of a complex, uncertain, ever-changing and highly volatile basin. However, for these decisions to take into account future uncertainties, like climate-change induced disasters, policy makers need to enhance their capacity in strategic foresight. Strategic foresight helps them make more robust decisions that take into account deep uncertainties and thus buffer the basin from future natural disasters. The authors explore the contribution of serious gaming in enhancing the Nile Basin policy makers' capacity on strategic foresight. They present the findings from the application of a game-based, experimental study of a serious game known as WeShareIt. WeShareIt was played in Nairobi on 22 October 2015 by 11 participants from the Kenyan Ministry of Water and Irrigation and Moi University Centre for Public Sector Reforms. Data on the added value and contribution of the game to increased strategic foresight and disaster risk reduction were collected using pre-game, in-game and post-game questionnaires, together with a debriefing session and observations. The analysis shows that strategic foresight is an important element for effective disaster risk reduction. Observations in the game-based intervention provided evidence that the participants engaged in short term quick decision making and were not prepared for life-threatening natural disasters. The results of the experiment support the conclusion that serious gaming may be an effective and promising method for enhancing the capacity of policy makers on strategic foresight so as to prepare them for future climate induced natural disasters. © 2016 The Authors.",Adaptation; Climate Change; Decision Support; Deep Uncertainty; Disaster; Nile; Risk Reduction; Serious Gaming; Strategic Foresight; Water Management,Decision making; Decision support systems; Disasters; Risk assessment; Surveys; Water management; Adaptation; Decision supports; Deep uncertainties; Nile; Risk reductions; Serious gaming; Strategic foresight; Climate change,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84993967409

In order to be easily deployable by national road administrations (NRAs), this framework is built in such a way that it can be embedded into asset management systems that include an inventory of the asset, inspection strategies (to report element conditions and safety defects) and decision-making for funds allocation. Using the inventory of the asset and condition assessment as input, the method aims to determine some degradation profiles for bridge components, retaining walls and steep embankments. The method to determine the degradation process is detailed so that any infrastructure manager can determine their own deterioration processes based on the inventory and condition assessment of their stock. Combining degradation of highway infrastructures with a risk analysis, this paper presents an optimization framework to determine optimal management strategies. © 2016 The Authors.",condition rating; highway infrastructures; optimization; risk analysis,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84991384681

They are two-sorted structures, based on RS-polarities with additional relations used to interpret modalities. We propose an intuitive, epistemic interpretation of RS-frames for modal logic, in terms of categorization systems and agents’ subjective interpretations of these systems. Categorization systems are a key to any decision-making process and are widely studied in the social and management sciences. A set of objects together with a set of properties and an incidence relation connecting objects with their properties forms a polarity which can be ‘pruned’ into an RS-polarity. Potential categories emerge as the Galois-stable sets of this polarity, just like the concepts of Formal Concept Analysis. An agent’s beliefs about objects and their properties (which might be partial) is modelled by a relation which gives rise to a normal modal operator expressing the agent’s beliefs about category membership. Fixed-points of the iterations of the belief modalities of all agents are used to model categories constructed through social interaction. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2016.",Categorization theory; Epistemic logic; Formal concept analysis; Lattice-based modal logic; RS-frames,Computation theory; Computational linguistics; Computer circuits; Decision making; Formal logic; Information analysis; Lattice theory; Management science; Reconfigurable hardware; Semantics; Categorization systems; Categorization theory; Decision making process; Epistemic logic; Modal logic; Relational semantics; RS-frames; Social interactions; Formal concept analysis,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84981489418

The adequate use, or the lack thereof, of emergency resources will affect the efficiency and even the success of emergency response activities or processes. Different emergency actions form certain relationships on using emergency resources. The cooperation modes of emergency actions on using resources are analyzed in this paper, and Petri-net models for these cooperation modes are provided. On this basis, an approach to detect emergency action conflicts resulting from resource-use is proposed. For conflicts caused by limited resources sharing, the queuing system which is modeled by a Petri-net and integrated into the model of emergency actions, is adopted to avoid conflicts. An example of an emergency response activity related with a fire accident is used to demonstrate the modeling method. The conflicts are analyzed and a queuing system is used to avoid simultaneously employing the same resource. © 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Conflict avoidance; Conflict detection; Emergency resource; Petri-net modeling; Queuing system,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84979609781

Human activities disturb the natural balance of these cycles by creating enormous additional nutrient fluxes, causing eutrophication of waterways and pollution in land systems. To tackle this problem, sustainable nutrient management is required. This paper addresses sustainable nutrient management in two countries: The Netherlands and Finland. We adopt a critical perspective on resource politics, especially towards opportunistic policy strategies for the pollutant management of N and P. Two research questions are considered. First, what are the key systemic and policy failures that occurred in the N and P systems in the Netherlands and Finland between 1970 and 2015? And second, which lessons can be drawn when addressing the policy responses in the two countries to cope with these failures? The cases are analyzed within Weber and Rohracher's framework that addresses ""failures"" preventing sustainable transitions. The results show that a number of failures occurred, besides market failures (over-exploitation of the commons, externalization of costs): lack of directionality, policy coordination, institutions, capabilities, infrastructure, demand articulation, and reflexivity. Policy responses in both countries resulted in ponderous policy frameworks that were adequate to tackle nutrient problems from the industrial sector and municipalities. However, both countries provided only a moderate response in terms of system-wide integrated policy frameworks to cope with sectoral-transcending issues. The agricultural use of N and P, in contrast to detergents, has not been subjected to strong regulatory measures. © 2016 by the authors.",Environmental policy; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Policy failure; Sustainable transition,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84970955859

A joint probability approach is widely applied to quantify the high water level frequency in deltas. In the approach the relevant hydrodynamic loading variables, namely the astronomical tides, the wind induced storm surge and the river flows, are jointly investigated. The joint probability distribution is used to generate a large number of scenarios of boundary conditions which can drive a deterministic model to derive the water levels at locations of interest. The resulting water levels as well as their associated joint probabilities can be inverted to the high water level frequency curve. However, in the joint probability distribution, marginal distributions may contain large statistical uncertainties due to their relevant parameters being estimated from a limited length of data. In the case of the Rhine Delta, a nonparametric bootstrap method is applied to quantify the statistical uncertainties in three critical marginal distributions: wind induced storm surge peak level, wind induced storm surge duration and River Rhine discharge. The uncertainties are incorporated into the marginal distributions with a Monte Carlo integration method. Further the uncertainty-incorporated marginal distributions are used for the high water level frequency assessment.

Yet many organizations are unable to adapt effectively or quickly due to the established institutional arrangements and patterns of decision-making and governance. Adaptive governance should enhance the capacity of an organization to deal with and adapt to changes, while protecting the same organization from becoming unstable. Strategies of adaptive governance include utilizing internal and external capabilities, decentralizing decision-making power, and seeking to inform higher-level decisions from bottom-up. At the same time, adaptive strategies may challenge stability and accountability, which remain essential for governments. This means that adaptive governance implies a 'balancing act', and a reliance on ambidextrous strategies.

Rehabilitation of ageing infrastructure and construction of new dams are widely viewed as solutions to diminish climate risk, but attaining the broad goal of freshwater sustainability will require expansion of the prevailing water resources management paradigm beyond narrow economic criteria to include socially valued ecosystem functions and services. We introduce a new decision framework, eco-engineering decision scaling (EEDS), that explicitly and quantitatively explores trade-offs in stakeholder-defined engineering and ecological performance metrics across a range of possible management actions under unknown future hydrological and climate states. We illustrate its potential application through a hypothetical case study of the Iowa River, USA.

Of special interest is identifying car drivers who also use public transport and/or bicycle, as this group is more likely to respond to policies that stimulate the use of those modes. It is suggested in the literature that this group may have less biased perceptions and different attitudes towards those modes. This supposition is examined in this paper by conducting a latent class cluster analysis, which identifies (multi)modal travel groups based on the self-reported frequency of mode use. Simultaneously, a membership function is estimated to predict the probability of belonging to each of the five identified (multi)modal travel groups, as a function of attitudinal variables in addition to structural variables. The results indicate that the (near) solo car drivers indeed have more negative attitudes towards public transport and bicycle, while frequent car drivers who also use public transport have less negative public transport attitudes. Although the results suggest that in four of the five identified travel groups, attitudes are congruent with travel mode use, this is not the case for the group who uses public transport most often. This group has relatively favorable car attitudes, and given that many young, low-income travelers belong to this group, it may be expected that at least part of this group will start using car more often once they can afford it. Based on the results, challenges for sustainable policies are formulated for each of the identified (multi)modal travel groups. © 2015.",Attitude; Factor analysis; Latent class cluster analysis; Mode choice; Mode frequency; Multimodality,Cluster analysis; Factor analysis; Membership functions; Attitude; Latent class cluster analysis; Mode choice; Mode frequencies; Multi-modality; Modal analysis; attitudinal survey; cluster analysis; factor analysis; transportation mode; travel behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949255899

Box 5048, Delft, 2600 GA, Netherlands","It is difficult to decide which power generation system is the most sustainable when environmental, economic and social sustainability aspects are taken into account. Problems with conventional environmental sustainability assessment methods are that no consensus exists about the applied models and weighting factors and that exergy losses are not considered. Economic sustainability assessment methods do not lead to results that are independent of time because they are influenced by market developments, while social sustainability assessment methods suffer from the availability and qualitative or semi-quantitative nature of data. Existing exergy analysis methods do not take into account all exergy losses and/or are extended with factors or equations that are not commonly accepted. The new Total Cumulative Exergy Loss (TCExL) method is based on fundamental thermodynamic equations and takes into account all exergy losses caused by a technological system during its life cycle, i.e. internal exergy losses, exergy losses caused by emission abatement and exergy losses related to land use. The development of the TCExL method is presented as well as the application of this method and environmental, economic and social sustainability assessment methods to two case studies: power generation in combination with LNG evaporation and Fossil versus renewable energy sources for power generation. According to the results of the assessments, large differences exist between the environmental sustainability assessment and TCExL methods in the sense that different parts of the systems contribute most to their overall scores. It is concluded from the case studies that involving the TCExL method in choices between power generation systems with the same energy sources has no consequences, i.e. it does not result in a different ranking of the systems, but can lead to the choice of a system that has a lower economic sustainability if the assessed systems use different energy sources. However, it must be noted that the economic sustainability changes over time, while the results of the TCExL method do not. © 2015 The Authors.

This extra public task has high costs and comes with high uncertainties. It may also compete with existing public tasks of network companies. When network companies are involved in local green initiatives, they encounter dilemmas and need to arrange trade-offs among multiple public values. It may also compete with existing tasks of network companies. Therefore, these network companies can face dilemmas when involved in local green initiatives. The aim of this paper is to reflect on the role of energy network companies in the face of these dilemmas. What is the role of energy network companies in coping with conflicting public values when helping local initiatives that create a greener energy system? Methods: We answer this question via an essay that reflects on existing research in the Dutch energy sector. Our answer is derived from the fields of law, politics, policy, economics and engineering about the role of network companies. Results and discussion: We argue that these five perspectives leave the role of energy network companies in the energy transition under-articulated. Our additional answer is based on our own empirical research that focuses on how network companies currently deal with dilemmas between multiple public tasks. Conclusion: We provide an analytical framework that enables a way of understanding the role of network companies in the struggle with dilemmas and raise several points of discussion to that might refocus efforts of researchers and practitioners to elucidate the role of network companies. © 2015, Steenhuisen and de Bruijne.",Economics; Energy network companies; Energy transition; Engineering; Law; Policy; Politics,Economics; Engineering; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Empirical research; Energy networks; Energy sector; Energy systems; Energy transitions; Law; Network company; Politics; Economic and social effects; cost-benefit analysis; empirical analysis; energy market; environmental economics; public service; research work; trade-off; uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939225632

However, the attempts made to design chemical plants with regard to LUP requirements have been few, most of which have neglected the role of domino effects in risk analysis of major accidents. To overcome the limitations of previous work, first, we developed a Bayesian network methodology to calculate both on-site and off-site risks of major accidents while taking domino effects into account. Second, we combined the results of risk analysis with Analytic Hierarchical Process to design an optimal layout for which the levels of on-site and off-site risks would be minimum. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.",Bayesian network; Domino effect; Fuel storage plant; Land use planning; Multi-criteria decision analysis,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84934325759

This paper explores the overall health impact of bicycle infrastructure provision, including not just road safety impacts, but also the population health impacts stemming from physical activity as well as cyclists' exposure to air pollution. Data and methods: We have summarised key publications on how bicycle paths and lanes affect cyclists' exposure to physical activity, air pollution, and road safety. The health impact is modelled using all-cause mortality as a metric for a scenario with new bicycle lanes and paths in a hypothetical city. Results: The outcomes of the study suggest that, based on currently available research, a reduction of all-cause mortality is to be expected from building bicycle lanes and paths along busy roads with mixed traffic. Increased physical activity through more time spent cycling is the major contribution, but is also the most uncertain aspect. Effects related to air pollution and cycling safety are likely to reduce mortality but are small. The overall benefits are large enough to achieve a high benefit-cost ratio for bicycle infrastructure. Conclusions: The introduction of bicycle paths and lanes is likely to be associated with health benefits, primarily due to increased physical activity. More research is needed to estimate the absolute size of the health benefits. In particular, evaluations of the effects of bicycle infrastructure on time spent cycling are limited or of insufficient quality to infer causality. We recommend before-after studies measuring the effects of different interventions and in areas representing a wide range of base levels of cycling participation. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Air pollution; Bicycle infrastructure; Cycling; Health; Physical activity; Road safety,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84949108353

The ability to use open data partly depends on the availability of open data technologies. However, the actual use of open data technologies has shown mixed results, and there is a paucity of research on the predictors affecting the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A better understanding of these predictors can help policy-makers to determine which policy instruments they can use to increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies. A modified model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) is used to empirically determine predictors influencing the acceptance and use of open data technologies. The results show that the predictors performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions and voluntariness of use together account for 45% of the variability in people's behavioral intention to use open data technologies. Except for facilitating conditions, all these predictors significantly influence behavioral intention. Our analysis of the predictors that influence the acceptance and use of open data technologies can be used to stimulate the use of open data technologies. The findings suggest that policy-makers should increase the acceptance and use of open data technologies by showing the benefits of open data use, by creating awareness of users that they already use open data, by developing social strategies to encourage people to stimulate each other to use open data, by integrating open data use in daily activities, and by decreasing the effort necessary to use open data technologies. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.",Acceptance; Adoption; Open data; Open data technology; Open government data; Open public sector data; Use; UTAUT,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84945571208

But predicting such responses now, and especially in the future, will not be possible. All we know about the future is that it will differ from the present. This includes the goals or objectives society wishes to achieve. But, in spite of this, decisions have to be made today that shape or influence the future we think we will want. What can policymakers do to better insure that a policy is able to achieve society's objectives over time? One way is to include members of society (or at least their behavior) in the policymaking process. Another way is to make the policy adaptive and include monitoring and learning so that new actions can be taken when conditions change. That is, policies should include provisions for being prepared for changes. In this paper we offer a conceptual model of a coupled social-water system, each component influencing decisions that affect the other over time. We give some examples of just how hard it is to attempt predictions, why, and what can go wrong if those predictions are wrong. And we offer some analytic approaches to policymaking that do not depend on such predictions.

In the present study, the analysis of industrial accidents induced by intentional acts of interference is carried out focusing on accident chains triggered by attacks with home-made (improvised) explosives. The effects of blast waves caused by improvised explosive devices are compared with those expected from a net equivalent charge of TNT by using a specific methodology for the assessment of stand-off distances. It is demonstrated that a home-made explosive device has a TNT efficiency comprised between 0.2 and 0.5. The model was applied to a case study, demonstrating the potentiality of improvised explosives in causing accident escalation sequences and severe effects on population and assets.

The combination of the extremely low frequency of cascading effects and the high complexity and interdependencies of process plants makes risk assessment and vulnerability analysis of process plants very challenging in the context of such events. In the present study, cascading effects were represented as a directed graph; accordingly, the efficacy of a set of graph metrics and measurements was examined in both unit and plant-wide vulnerability analysis of process plants. We demonstrated that vertex-level closeness and betweenness can be used in the unit vulnerability analysis of process plants for the identification of critical units within a process plant. Furthermore, the graph-level closeness metric can be used in the plant-wide vulnerability analysis for the identification of the most vulnerable plant layout with respect to the escalation of cascading effects. Furthermore, the results from the application of the graph metrics have been verified using a Bayesian network methodology. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.",Bayesian network; Cascading effect; Graph metrics; Process plant; Vulnerability analysis,Bayesian networks; Complex networks; Directed graphs; Flammable materials; Graph theory; High pressure effects; High pressure engineering; Risk assessment; Cascading effects; Explosive materials; Extremely low frequencies; Graph metrics; High pressure high temperature; Network methodologies; Process plants; Vulnerability analysis; Network security,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84939261464

The subject of this paper is the variability of transport modes used by individuals in their weekly travel. Our review shows that previous studies have not allowed the full use of different modes in weekly travel to be taken into account, have used categorical variables as simple indicators of modal variability and have only considered a limited set of explanatory indicators in seeking to explain modal variability. In our analysis we use National Travel Survey data for Great Britain. We analyse modal variability with continuous measures of modal variability (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, the difference in mode share between the primary and secondary mode, the total number of modes used). Taking inspiration from Hägerstrand (1970), we conceive that modal variability is determined by different types of spatial mobility constraints and find that reduced modal variability is predicted for having mobility difficulties, being aged over 60, being non-white, working full-time, living in smaller settlement, lower household income, having regular access to a car, having no public transport pass/season ticket and not owning a bicycle. The findings can support a change in perspective in transport policy from encouraging people to replace the use of one mode with another to encouraging people to make a change to their relative use of different transport modes. © 2015 The Authors.",Intrapersonal variability; Mobility constraints; Modal variability; Mode choice; Multimodality,Surveys; Intrapersonal variability; Mobility constraints; Modal variability; Mode choice; Multi-modality; Behavioral research; spatial analysis; survey method; transportation mode; transportation policy; travel behavior; travel demand; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84931263126

We apply a log odds random effects regression model on hospital micro data. We introduce the concept of clustering innovations and the application of a log odds random effects regression model to describe the diffusion of technologies. We distinguish a number of determinants, such as service, physician, and environmental, financial and organizational characteristics of the 60 Dutch hospitals in our sample. On the basis of this data set on Dutch general hospitals over the period 1995-2002, we conclude that there is a relation between a number of determinants and the diffusion of innovations underlining conclusions from earlier research. Positive effects were found on the basis of the size of the hospitals, competition and a hospital's commitment to innovation. It appears that if a policy is developed to further diffuse innovations, the external effects of demand and market competition need to be examined, which would de facto lead to an efficient use of technology. For the individual hospital, instituting an innovations office appears to be the most prudent course of action. © 2013 The Authors.

And (2) what factors support the effective use of particular tools and technologies toward constructive outcomes?

As the largest dam in the world by far, Three Gorges Dam (TGD) is expected to be a strong evidence on dam impacts on downstream hydrological regime. In this study, statistical methods are performed on the pre- and post-TGD daily hydrological data at Yichang, Hankou, and Datong stations to detect the daily, monthly, yearly, and spatial fluctuations in river hydrology along the Yangtze River during the period of 2000–2013. It is found that TGD makes a significant hydrological variation along the Yangtze River following the dam operation since 2003. Specifically, the daily discharge and water level are gathered to normal event ranges with less extreme events than before 2003. Both maximum and minimum daily water levels at the study stations have decreased due to TGD-induced riverbed incision. The operation of TGD shifts the maximum monthly discharge and water level from August to July at Yichang station. The significance of TGD effect on discharge and water level relationship presents spatial variation. The rating curves at upstream reach experience the most significant effects with a substantial upward shift, while those at lower reach only suggest slight modification. Of the potential drivers considered in this study, dam regulation is responsible for the changes in downstream river hydrology. Moreover, the tributary and adjoining riparian lakes of the Yangtze River contribute to weaken the effect of TGD on downstream hydrological behavior. ©2015.

However, deep uncertainties associated with climate change pose significant challenges to adaptation planning. Specifically, current transportation planning methods are ill-equipped to address deep uncertainties, as they rely on designing responses to a few predicted futures, none of which will occur exactly as envisioned. In this paper, we propose using dynamic adaptive planning (DAP), an emerging general strategic planning method, to account for deep uncertainties by building flexibility and learning mechanisms into plans that enable continuous adaptation throughout implementation. This paper first reviews uncertainty in general, introduces what is meant by deep uncertainty, and then introduces DAP. Then, DAP is applied to a case study of the Oakland approach to the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, which was initially assessed under the 2010-2011 FHWA Climate Change Vulnerability Assessment Pilot program, to illustrate how DAP could be applied as a response to climate change in the context of evolving transportation infrastructure adaptation planning practices in the United States. We conclude that DAP is well suited to account for the deep uncertainties of climate change in transportation and infrastructure planning, and provide suggestions for further research to better apply DAP in this field. © 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers.",Adaptation; Climate change; Deep uncertainty; Dynamic adaptive planning (DAP); Transportation infrastructure,Toll bridges; Transportation; Adaptation; Deep uncertainties; Dynamic-adaptive; Infrastructure planning; San francisco-oakland bay bridges; Transportation infrastructures; Transportation planning; Vulnerability assessments; Climate change; climate change; design; dynamic analysis; infrastructure planning; network analysis; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; California; San Francisco Bay; United States,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84947775576

Participatory policy making involves stakeholders in various stages of the policy process and can focus on both the substance of the policy problem or on improving the tools and processes of policy development. We examine five international cases of stakeholder engagement in policy development to explore two questions: (1) what types of engagement tools and processes are useful for different stakeholders and contexts? And (2) what factors support the effective use of particular tools and technologies toward constructive outcomes? The cases address e-government strategic planning in a developing country, energy policy in a transitional economy, development of new technology and policy innovations in global trade, exploration of tools for policy-relevant evidence in early childhood decision making, and development of indicators for evaluating policy options in urban planning. Following a comparison of the cases, we discuss salient factors of stakeholder selection and representation, stakeholder support and education, the value of stakeholder engagement for dealing with complexity, and the usefulness of third-party experts for enhancing transparency and improving tools for engagement. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.",,,Book Chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84944625703

The models currently used to get insight in supply chains assume a predefined supply chain structure, as orders are exogenously defined. Consequently, those models cannot grasp the dynamic nature of supply chains with modular plants. In this paper a market conceptualization based on agent-based computational economics is presented that includes transport costs in the negotiations and enables the modeling of supply chains as structures that emerge from market dynamics. It is shown that this conceptualization can capture the market dynamics that are needed to simulate a dynamic supply chain. © 2015 The Authors. Published by WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

But how can a resilient solution in flood protection be successfully implemented? Using insights from the major Dutch flood-protection project 'Room for the River', this article studies the governance of resilience. From a political perspective, resilience is often a win-lose game with many uncertainties. The actors involved have strong incentives to exploit these uncertainties and to hamper resilience based policies. The 'Room for the River'-project was based upon the idea of resilience and had a win-lose character. Nevertheless, the many actors involved, with their conflicting interests, managed to reach consensus by broadening the agenda and by making flood protection a multi-issue game. © 2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Flood protection; Governance; Resilience; Water management,Floods; Rivers; Water management; Engineering research; Flood control; Systems engineering; Flood protection; Governance; Multi-issue; Netherlands; Political perspective; Resilience; Flood control; Floods,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938575334

In order to account for specific challenges associated with different kinds of model applications we classify models according to their uses: for understanding transitions, for providing case-specific policy advice, and for facilitating stakeholder processes. The assessment reveals promising research directions for transition modeling, such as model-to-model analysis, pattern-oriented modeling, advanced sensitivity analysis, development of a shared conceptual framework, and use of modeling protocols. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

However, only a limited number of methodologies refers to how to move from a conceptual model to an executable simulation model. Besides, existing M&S methodologies do not typically provide a formal method for model transformations between the models in different stages of the development process. Hence, in the current M&S practice, model continuity is usually not fulfilled. In this article, a model-driven development framework for M&S is presented to bridge the gap between different stages of a simulation study and to obtain model continuity. The applicability of the framework is illustrated with a prototype modeling environment and a case study in the discrete event simulation domain. © 2015 ACM.",Conceptual modeling; Discrete event simulation; Metamodeling; Model transformation; Modeldriven development,Data mining; Formal methods; Conceptual model; Development process; Metamodeling; Model and simulation; Model driven development; Model transformation; Prototype models; Simulation studies; Discrete event simulation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84928521970

This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods to investigate the impact on costs of vertical separation. We find the impact to vary with circumstances, but for more densely used railways and those with a higher proportion of freight traffic, vertical separation raises costs. It appears that the main reason for this is the misalignment of incentives, leading each player to seek to optimise their own costs rather than those of the system as a whole. Various approaches are used to try to overcome this misalignment, through track access charges, performance regimes and various forms of partnership, but none is fully successful. We also find no evidence that complete vertical separation leads to more competition, or indeed that such an increase in competition reduces costs, though we consider that further work is needed to better measure the extent of competition in different markets. From a policy perspective our findings suggest that alternative railway structures will suit different railways with different patterns of usage and therefore a policy that seeks to impose complete vertical separation on all EU members would increase costs. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost; D23; Incentives; L22; L24; L92; Railways; Structure; Transactions,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84919871571

This paper investigates the role that carbon markets could have in facilitating the implementation of composting, anaerobic digestion and biochar production, in the city of Tamale, in the North of Ghana. Through a life cycle assessment of implementation scenarios for low-tech, small scale variants of the above mentioned three technologies, the potential contribution they could give to climate change mitigation was assessed. Furthermore an economic assessment was carried out to study their viability and the impact thereon of accessing carbon markets. It was found that substantial climate benefits can be achieved by avoiding landfilling of organic waste, producing electricity and substituting the use of chemical fertilizer. Biochar production could result in a net carbon sequestration. These technologies were however found not to be economically viable without external subsidies, and access to carbon markets at the considered carbon price of 7. EUR/ton of carbon would not change the situation significantly. Carbon markets could help the realization of the considered composting and anaerobic digestion systems only if the carbon price will rise above 75-84.

Because climate change effects may be severe, a next step is to study not only the effects on natural systems, but also the effects on built infrastructure systems and, in response to anticipated effects, the adaptation of those systems. Studies that discuss interconnected infrastructures, society's backbones, in light of climate change are emerging. We apply a socio-technical systems perspective in order to gain insight into the effects of climate change on our infrastructure systems and possible adaption strategies for the coming decades. We use this perspective to collect and describe the literature on adaptation of infrastructures to climate change. We find that the analysed papers predominantly focus on specific geographic areas and that various types of impacts on and interdependencies of built socio-technical systems are recognized, not only for energy and transport, but also for water infrastructures. A missing step is the modelling of adaptation measures. Recent literature enables an exploration of strategies for adaptation, which should be expected in the coming years. © 2014 The Authors.",Adaptation; Climate change; Infrastructures; Literature review; Socio-technical systems,adaptive management; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; environmental policy; literature review; policy strategy; strategic approach,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84907735648

The economic cost of such failures is in the order of tens of billion dollars annually. The loading level of power system is a key aspect to determine the amount of the damage caused by cascading failures. Existing studies show that the blackout size exhibits phase transitions as the loading level increases. This paper investigates the impact of the topology of a power grid on phase transitions in its robustness. Three spectral graph metrics are considered: spectral radius, effective graph resistance and algebraic connectivity.

In particular, a co-opetitive situation, in which remanufacturing is undertaken only by retailers while the OEMs' role is restricted to recycling is considered. After adopting a resource-based perspective of competition, investigations are accomplished using system dynamics simulation modelling. The results of simulations indicate that, in the long run, OEMs, regardless of the operation strategy they adopt, are unable to (re)capture the market gained by the remanufacturers. However, some of these strategies contribute to the improvement of the environmental performance of the entire supply chain.

Through the certificate-based authentication protocol, Web services and Internet users first authenticate one another (""shake hands"") using a TLS/SSL certificate, encrypt Web communications end-to-end, and show a padlock in the browser to signal that a communication is secure. In recent years, HTTPS has become an essential technology to protect social, political, and economic activities online. At the same time, widely reported security incidents-such as DigiNotar's breach, Apple's #gotofail, and OpenSSL's Heartbleed-have exposed systemic security vulnerabilities of HTTPS to a global audience. The Edward Snowden revelations-notably around operation BULLRUN, MUSCULAR, and the lesser-known FLYING PIG program to query certificate metadata on a dragnet scale-have driven the point home that HTTPS is both a major target of government hacking and eavesdropping, as well as an effective measure against dragnet content surveillance when Internet traffic traverses global networks. HTTPS, in short, is an absolutely critical but fundamentally flawed cybersecurity technology. While the Heartbleed incident illuminated severe flaws in a widely used crypto-library of HTTPS (OpenSSL), the focus here is on the systemic security vulnerabilities in the HTTPS authentication model that precedes end-to-end encryption. Although some of these vulnerabilities have been known for years, the 2011 security breach at the small Dutch CA (certificate authority) known as DigiNotar was a watershed moment, demonstrating these theoretical man-in-the-middle vulnerabilities in the wild. Meanwhile, large CAs such as Comodo and Verisign have experienced breaches as well but didn't suffer similar consequences to DigiNotar. In fact, some large CAs actually benefited from the increased sense of HTTPS insecurity. Policymakers and technologists are increasingly advocating various solutions to address the security collapse of HTTPS. The European Union is halfway through adopting the world's first comprehensive legislation on HTTPS. It will acquire immediate binding force in the legal systems of 28 European member states. As most large CAs operate (also) under E.U. jurisdiction, the legislation will impact HTTPS governance globally. In the U.S., on the other hand, attention has focused on technological solutions and industry self-regulation. To evaluate both legal and technological solutions, an understanding of the economic incentives of the stakeholders in the HTTPS ecosystem, most notably the CAs, is essential.2,3 This article outlines the systemic vulnerabilities of HTTPS, maps the thriving market for certificates, and analyzes the suggested regulatory and technological solutions on both sides of the Atlantic. The findings show existing yet surprising market patterns and perverse incentives: not unlike the financial sector, the HTTPS market is full of information asymmetries and negative externalities, as a handful of CAs dominate the market and have become ""too big to fail."" Unfortunately, the proposed E.U. legislation will reinforce systemic vulnerabilities, and the proposed technological solutions are far from being adopted at scale. The systemic vulnerabilities in this crucial technology are likely to persist for years to come. © 2014 ACM.",,Authentication; Commerce; Cryptography; Economic and social effects; Hypertext systems; Internet protocols; Laws and legislation; Mammals; Mobile telecommunication systems; Network security; Personal computing; Web services; Authentication models; Authentication protocols; End-to-end encryption; Industry self-regulations; Information asymmetry; Negative externalities; Security vulnerabilities; Technological solution; HTTP,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84908111085

We apply this function distortion method to a sample model and identify a number of shortcomings, such as a limited variety of alternative forms. We then propose extensions to the method to address the shortcomings, and subsequently test the extensions. We find the (extended) method of function distortion to be readily applicable and efficient in testing the sensitivity of model outputs to variations in the form of graphical functions.

Secure electrical power supply requires, together with careful operation, a robust design of the electrical power grid topology. Currently, the impact of the topology on grid robustness is mainly assessed by purely topological approaches, that fail to capture the essence of electric power flow. This paper proposes a metric, the effective graph resistance, to relate the topology of a power grid to its robustness against cascading failures by deliberate attacks, while also taking the fundamental characteristics of the electric power grid into account such as power flow allocation according to Kirchhoff laws. Experimental verification on synthetic power systems shows that the proposed metric reflects the grid robustness accurately. The proposed metric is used to optimize a grid topology for a higher level of robustness. To demonstrate its applicability, the metric is applied on the IEEE 118 bus power system to improve its robustness against cascading failures. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

They take a nuanced stand, not only looking at failures of Western development initiatives, but also going into the internal dynamics of African societies that stand in the way of social and economic development. Next, authors present some case studies of entrepreneurial development initiatives in Kenya. These cases show the difficulties in terms of organization and capacities such initiatives have to deal with and they take into onsideration the bigger picture in terms of sector development, regulation, and finally civil society and governance issues. Kenya is caught up between a value set of traditional values adapted to small-scale ethnic societies, which doesn’t exercise its cohesive function like it once did and the modern large-scale and open civil society values, which are not yet fully in place. Authors contend that progress must involve a mutual reinforcement involving combination of entrepreneurial skills and capacities (i.e. initiatives from below and adequate institutionalization and regulation from above). © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2014.",Civil society; Cultural and institutional transition; Entrepreneurship; Technology transfer,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84951190284

The ability to estimate models on subsets of the alternatives is thus of great appeal, and correction approaches have existed since the late 1970s for the simple multinomial logit (MNL) model. However, many of these models in practice rely on nested logit specifications, for example, in the context of the joint choice of mode and destination. Recent research has put forward solutions for such generalized extreme value (GEV) structures, but these structures remain difficult to apply in practice. This paper puts forward a simplification of the GEV method for use in computationally efficient implementations of nested logit. The good performance of this approach is illustrated with simulated data, and additional insights into sampling error are also provided with different sampling strategics for MNL.",,Computationally efficient; Correction approaches; Generalized extreme value; Large-scale models; Multinomial Logit; Practical solutions; Recent researches; Transport applications; Transportation,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84938563035

Given the unpredictable and uncertain futures, implementation of the resulting adaptive policies needs to be informed by regular monitoring. However, monitoring implementation in practice is complicated by the need to coordinate activities and share information among multiple actors. Here we present a first outline for an approach to organise collaborative monitoring to support adaptive implementation of long-term water policies. The analytical basis rests on an extension of Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways with actor analysis principles. Monitoring is to be organised around adaptation tipping points, for which a set of questions needs to be addressed that put societal actors central. Examples from two water management cases in the Netherlands suggest the usefulness of this approach.

More specifically, we investigate to what extent choices for leisure activities and related travels are driven by the satisfaction of needs. In addition to conventional attributes (such as activity costs), our regret based discrete choice model incorporates latent variables representing the anticipated level of individual needs-satisfaction by a particular leisure activity. The latent variables are calibrated with the help of subjective indicators of needs-satisfaction associated with the leisure activities. Results show that needs-satisfaction allows us to decompose a substantial share of the unobserved heterogeneity in leisure activity-travel decisions across respondents. Identifying the structural drivers of anticipated needs-satisfaction also enables a better prediction of leisure activity choice. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Bayesian modelling; Hybrid choice models; Leisure activities; Needs-satisfaction,Bayesian analysis; discrete choice analysis; heterogeneity; numerical model; recreational activity; travel behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84904622073

Theorizing on this subject covers a diverse pallet of concepts such as ""resilience"" and ""safety management systems"". Recent studies indicate that safety management theory has deficiencies. Our interpretation of these deficiencies is that much confusion originates from the issue that crucial meta-theoretical assumptions are mostly implicit or applied inconsistently. In particular, we argue that these meta-theoretical assumptions are of a systems theoretical nature. Therefore, we provide a framework that will be able to explicate and reflect on systems theoretical assumptions. With this framework, we analyze the ability of two frequently used safety management theories to tackle the problem of managing safety of Dutch military expeditionary organizations. This paper will show that inconsistent and implicit application of systems theoretical assumptions in these safety management theories results in problems to tackle such a practical problem adequately. We conclude with a reflection on the pros and cons of our framework. Also, we suggest particular meta-theoretical aspects that seem to be essential for applying safety management theory to organizations. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",General systems theory; Military operations; Resilience engineering; Safety management systems; Safety management theory,Military operations; Planning; Societies and institutions; General systems theory; Key topics; Practical problems; Resilience engineerings; Safety management; Safety management systems; Safety science; Safety engineering; accident prevention; article; concept analysis; conceptual framework; engineering; environmental management; human; military deployment; military service; Netherlands; occupational hazard; occupational safety; organization; priority journal; problem solving; risk management; risk reduction; safety; theory,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84903905383

The occurrence and combination of crises seems to be indicative of what one would expect from the adverse effects of centre-periphery relations among countries.

An adaptation pathway is a sequence of policy actions to reach specified objectives. To develop adaptation pathways, interactions between environment and policy response need to be analysed over time for an ensemble of plausible futures. A fast, integrated model can facilitate this. Here, we describe the development and evaluation of such a model, an Integrated Assessment Metamodel (IAMM), to explore adaptation pathways in the Rhine delta for a decision problem currently faced by the Dutch Government. The theory-motivated metamodel is a simplified physically based model. Closed questions reflecting the required accuracy were used to evaluate the model's fitness. The results show that such a model fits the purpose of screening and ranking of policy options and pathways to support the strategic decision making.

To achieve this objective, the literature has been reviewed and a scenario about the publication and use of open data has been analyzed. It was found that various applications, tools and portals are available which together can form an ecosystem. The best functionalities of this ecosystem can be selected and utilized by open data providers and users. To create an open data ecosystem at least four key elements should be captured, namely, 1) releasing and publishing open data on the internet, 2) searching, finding, evaluating and viewing data and their related licenses, 3) cleansing, analyzing, enriching, combining, linking and visualizing data and 4) interpreting and discussing data and providing feedback to the data provider and other stakeholders.

Often, these battles result in a single standard that achieves dominance. Decision making in standards battles is complex due to the lack of insights about the factors that influence the outcome of such battles. These include the characteristics of the standard, the stakeholders, the standard supporters, and the standard support strategies. The importance of these factors determines the dominance of a technology standard. This study investigates the usability of a multiattribute utility approach named fuzzy analytic hierarchy process in decision making in technology standards battles. Three technology standards battles are analyzed using a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process approach. The empirical results show that the outcome of these standards battles is not fully characterized by path dependency, but that factors for standard dominance can be used to explain the outcome of these battles. We show that it is possible to model the process of standard selection. The fuzzy analytic hierarchy process decision support tool is useful to determine the relative weight of factors for standard dominance, and can be successfully used in decision-making problems relating to standardization. © 1988-2012 IEEE.",Analytical hierarchy/network process; decision support systems; decisions under risk and uncertainty; fuzzy and gray systems; management of innovation; strategic management of ITT; technology diffusion,Analytic hierarchy process; Artificial intelligence; Decision making; Decision support systems; Technology; Analytical hierarchies; Gray system; Management of innovation; Risk and uncertainty; Strategic management; Technology diffusion; Standards,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84899564194

Five photovoltaic technologies are currently commercially available and it is still unclear which of these technologies will emerge as the dominant design. Based on the literature and on expert interviews, we develop and analyze categories and factors for technology dominance for these systems. By applying the analytic hierarchy process, we determine the importance of these factors and the chances of one of these five technologies becoming the dominant photovoltaic technology. The crisp and fuzzy (logarithmic fuzzy preference programming) analytic hierarchy process method is used to analyze the data. The results show that the standard support strategy is the most important category, and that pricing strategy and technological superiority are the most influential factors in the dominance process. Furthermore, the first generation technology mono-crystalline silicon photovoltaic has the best chance of achieving dominance (30% chance). The results of this study are useful for multiple stakeholders (e.g. energy policy makers and photovoltaic module companies) who have to make the decision as to which standard should be supported for photovoltaic technology. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.",Analytic hierarchy process; Dominant design; Logarithmic fuzzy preference programming; Photovoltaic technology; Technology selection process,Analytic hierarchy process; Photovoltaic cells; Dominant design; Energy policy makers; Fuzzy preference programming; Generation technologies; Multiple stakeholders; Photovoltaic modules; Photovoltaic technology; Technology selection; Monocrystalline silicon,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84893716338

Our proposed model advances the state of the art of RU-RR mixture models by (i) adding and simultaneously estimating a membership model which predicts the probability of belonging to a RU or RR class; (ii) adding a layer of random taste heterogeneity within each behavioural class; and (iii) deriving a welfare measure associated with the RU-RR mixture model and consistent with referendum-voting, which is the adequate mechanism of provision for such local public goods.

We find that the random parameter RU-RR mixture model not only outperforms its fixed coefficient counterpart in terms of fit-as expected-but also in terms of plausibility of membership determinants of behavioural class.

The computation of different aggregation functions, e.g., summation, average, maximum etc., in large-scale distributed systems is challenging and crucial for a wide range of applications. This is especially the case when the input values of these functions dynamically change during system runtime. Related approaches of decentralized aggregation are function-dependent, interaction-dependent, assume static values or cannot always tolerate duplicates and continuously changing information. Methods: This paper introduces DIAS, the Dynamic Intelligent Aggregation Service. DIAS is an agent-based middleware that addresses these issues with a holistic approach: an efficient availability of the distributed information in every node of the network that enables the simultaneous computation of almost any aggregation function. Such an abstraction initially requires a significant communication and storage cost and has a rather large overhead. These issues are resolved by introducing an implicit local representation and storage of the explicit distributed information: aggregation memberships in bloom filters. Results: The performance impact of bloom filters in DIAS is critical for its applicability as it compensates and reduces the initial high communication and storage required for such an abstraction. Conclusions: Experimental evaluation under various aggregation and resource-constrained settings shows that DIAS is an efficient and accurate decentralized aggregation service. © 2013, Pournaras et al.; licensee Springer.",Adaptation; Agent; Aggregation; Bloom filter; Consistency,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84941597128

Focusing on validity issues, we study five cases in which the Dutch railway sector used gaming simulation to test innovations in a controlled environment. The results show that in addition to traditional external validity issues, human game players inherently open up this controlled environment, bringing in many confounding variables.

We illustrate, through four medium-scale surveys in the Levant, that the potential for public participation is present, even in countries with limited exercise of democracy. The study demonstrates that the public is willing to participate and knowledgeable about water management challenges at both the institutional and household level.

Experiences in the Netherlands are analyzed by studying four specific action situations, such as asset management at drinking water company Vitens NV. Potential lessons are derived from this, which are evaluated for potential transfer to Malawi. The analysis suggests ways in which improved information gathering and data management can support allocation of investment and budgets for operation and maintenance.

Despite their potential these technologies are seldom integrated or used in administrative organizations. SWS can be adopted to present functionality needed in processes, whereas the elicitation of BR is an important ingredient for process creation. In this paper, we derive and test guidelines for creating administrative processes that are dynamical created using SWSs and BRs that are derived from policies.

Designers need to consider socio-technical uncertainties, intricacies, and processes in the long-term strategic deployment and operations of these systems. Flexibility in engineering design provides ways to deal with this complexity. It enables engineering systems to change in the face of uncertainty to reduce impacts from downside scenarios (e.g.; unfavorable market conditions) while capitalizing on upside opportunities (e.g.; new technology). Many case studies have shown that flexibility can improve anticipated lifecycle performance (e.g.; expected economic value) compared to current design and evaluation approaches. It is a difficult process requiring guidance and must be done at an early conceptual stage. The literature offers little guidance on procedures helping designers do this systematically in a collaborative context. This study investigated the effects of two educational training procedures on flexibility (current vs. explicit) and two ideation procedures (free undirected brainstorming vs. prompting) to guide this process and improve anticipated lifecycle performance. Controlled experiments were conducted with ninety participants working on a simplified engineering systems design problem. Results suggest that a prompting mechanism for flexibility can help generate more flexible design concepts than free undirected brainstorming. These concepts can improve performance significantly (by up to 36 %) compared to a benchmark design - even though users did not expect improved quality of results. Explicit training on flexibility can improve user satisfaction with the process, results, and results quality in comparison with current engineering and design training on flexibility. These findings give insights into the crafting and application of simple, intuitive, and efficient procedures to improve lifecycle performance by means of flexibility and performance that may be left aside with existing design approaches. The experimental results are promising toward further evaluation in a real-world setting. © 2012 Springer-Verlag London.",Conceptual design; Design procedures; Empirical evaluation; Flexibility in engineering design; Real options,Communication infrastructure; Controlled experiment; Design and evaluations; Design procedure; Empirical evaluations; Engineering design; Life-cycle performance; Real Options; Benchmarking; Conceptual design; Life cycle; Engineering,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84880297686

Drawing on a sample of 79 Turkish small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), the authors find negative direct effects of innovation-based strategy and university collaboration on the profit growth of firms. Howeve,where there is fierce market competition, they find that an innovation-based strategy increases profit growth and that collaboration with universities needs to exceed a certain level before the benefits are manifested in profit growth. These results contribute to the debate on the role of innovation and university collaboration in the profit growth of SMEs in emerging countries. For managers, the implications are that an innovation-based strategy is important in competitive markets in emerging countries, and that university collaboration needs to be taken more seriously and must involve higher levels of effort and commitment if benefits are to emerge; otherwise, companies may decide against working with universities.",Business performance; Innovation-based strategy; Market competition; Profit margin growth; University-industry collaboration,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875394560

We illustrate our approach with a tool for collaborative non-linear storytelling in which users can jointly create a story graph of interconnected audio files. Such a story graph is an example for a non-linear story. We describe the development of a prototype that visualizes how the collaborative story has evolved over time. We evaluate our approach for asynchronous awareness support in an experiment with 40 participants exploring story graphs of different complexity.

According to this paradigm, a planner should create a strategic vision of the future, commit to short-term actions, and establish a framework to guide future actions. A plan that embodies these ideas allows for its dynamic adaptation over time to meet changing circumstances. We propose a method for decisionmaking under uncertain global and regional changes called 'Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways'. We base our approach on two complementary approaches for designing adaptive plans: 'Adaptive Policymaking' and 'Adaptation Pathways'. Adaptive Policymaking is a theoretical approach describing a planning process with different types of actions (e.g. 'mitigating actions' and 'hedging actions') and signposts to monitor to see if adaptation is needed. In contrast, Adaptation Pathways provides an analytical approach for exploring and sequencing a set of possible actions based on alternative external developments over time. We illustrate the Dynamic Adaptive Policy Pathways approach by producing an adaptive plan for long-term water management of the Rhine Delta in the Netherlands that takes into account the deep uncertainties about the future arising from social, political, technological, economic, and climate changes. The results suggest that it is worthwhile to further test and use the approach. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Adaptation pathways; Adaptive policies; Policymaking; Rhine delta; Uncertainty; Water management,adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; literature review; paradigm shift; uncertainty analysis; water management; Netherlands; Rhine Delta,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84878015971

It can be theoretically supported by agency theory, in which strategic behaviour is the result of asymmetric information between the principal and agent.

This is a game with incomplete information which considers the way in which parties anticipate upon other parties' behaviour in choosing a course of action. The game shows how cost overruns are the result of an inappropriate signal. This makes it impossible for the principal to distinguish between the types of agents, and hence, allows for strategic behaviour.

Amongst others, he ridicules capability theorists for demanding compensation for each and every possible natural difference between people, including hair types. Not only does Pogge, so this paper argues, misconstrue the difference between the capability approach and Rawlsian resourcism. Even worse: he is actually implicitly relying on the idea of capabilities in his defence of the latter. According to him the resourcist holds that the institutional order should not be biased towards the average person or the needs of some. Yet, as his own case of blind people and traffic lights can illustrate, whether or not this is the case is impossible to assess without resorting to some concept like people's capabilities. Secondly, it is argued that the real issue at stake is not at all the best metric of justice-primary goods or capabilities-but rather the scope of theories of justice. On the surface the difference of opinion seems to be how to deal with so-called ""personal heterogeneities"", yet the discussed case of interpersonal differences in metabolism and communal land-use choices hints at something else; Whereas Pogge insists that questions of justice only concern the institutional structure of society, many capability theorists support the inclusion of culture and social practices as possible sources of injustice. Unfortunately Pogge does not properly acknowledge this, as right from the start of his paper he frames the debate between both approaches in terms of institutions only. © 2012 The Author(s).",Capability approach; Human capabilities; Primary goods; Rawlsian resourcism; Thomas Pogge,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84872786920

Furthermore we introduce a new theoretical framework. In this framework adaptation effects in longitudinal driving behavior are assumed to consist of compensation effects and performance effects. In order to empirically underpin this framework we show in this paper that compensation effects are reflected in parameter value changes in the Intelligent Driver Model, while performance effects are reflected in a reduction in model performance. Furthermore we show that compensation effects following an emergency situation are reflected in a change in the position of perceptual thresholds in a psycho-spacing model while performance effects are reflected in a reduced sensitivity of acceleration towards lead vehicle related stimuli at the action points.

In this research coordination needs and challenges for open data and coordination mechanisms that can help in improving coordination are identified. A literature review shows that the opening and use of data are isolated and unrelated processes. Open data publishers do not profit from the wisdom of the crowd by having knowledge of how their data are reused. In addition, results of data reuse are not discussed and little feedback is gained by data providers, in this way barely supporting policy and decision-making. Coordination mechanisms, such as standardization and interconnected processes, can enable open data providers to profit from publishing data and to use this for improving their policy-making and decision-making. Yet, it is difficult to coordinate the open data process with these coordination mechanisms due to the complexity, lack of structure, uncertainty, dynamism, and the involvement of varying stakeholders in the open data process.

We argue that a sustainable plan should not only achieve economic, environmental, and social objectives, but should be robust and able to be adapted over time to (unforeseen) future conditions. Large numbers of papers dealing with robustness and adaptive plans have begun to appear, but the literature is fragmented. The papers appear in disparate journals, and deal with a wide variety of policy domains. This paper (1) describes and compares a family of related conceptual approaches to designing a sustainable plan, and (2) describes several computational tools supporting these approaches. The conceptual approaches all have their roots in an approach to longterm planning called Assumption-Based Planning. Guiding principles for the design of a sustainable adaptive plan are: explore a wide variety of relevant uncertainties, connect short-term targets to long-term goals over time, commit to short-term actions while keeping options open, and continuously monitor the world and take actions if necessary. A key computational tool across the conceptual approaches is a fast, simple (policy analysis) model that is used to make large numbers of runs, in order to explore the full range of uncertainties and to identify situations in which the plan would fail. © 2013 by the authors.",Adaptation pathways; Adaptation tipping points; Adaptive policymaking; Deep uncertainty; Dynamic adaptive policy pathways; Exploratory modeling and analysis; Meta-models; Robust decision making; Scenario discovery; Sustainable adaptive plans,adaptive management; conceptual framework; decision making; planning process; policy analysis; policy approach; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84879306495

For example, the policy that sales data should not leave an organization is refined into policies on door locks, firewalls and employee behavior, and this refinement should be correct with respect to the original policy. Although alignment of security policies in socio-technical systems has been discussed in the literature, especially in relation to business goals, there has been no formal treatment of this topic so far in terms of consistency and completeness of policies. Wherever formal approaches are used in policy alignment, these are applied to well-defined technical access control scenarios instead. Therefore, we aim at formalizing security policy alignment for complex socio-technical systems in this paper, and our formalization is based on predicates over sequences of actions.

In this regard, this paper focuses on analyzing evolution and deployment of different policies and execution of strategies by two countries. It analyzes the effects of the biomass energy policies and executed strategies in India and Indonesia with a holistic approach. Such an approach takes the policy and strategy of the whole biomass energy sector rather than a segmented and separated sector as biofuel, biogas, biodiesel, etc. Furthermore, how they have resulted in different outcomes is also addressed. Our analysis shows that India's biomass energy policy has evolved from incremental to more radical changes, while Indonesia's policy remains incremental. India has also a relatively more unified biomass energy strategy than Indonesia. India has been more focused on technology development and deployment along with strong institutional creation, whereas Indonesia has not been able to create any biomass sector supporting strong institutions. Therefore, in terms of biomass energy utilizations, India has demonstrated better performance than Indonesia. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Biomass energy; India; Indonesia; Policy; Strategy; Sustainability,Energy policy; Public policy; Sustainable development; Bio-mass energy; Biomass resources; Biomass sector; Holistic approach; India; Indonesia; Strategy; Technology development; Biomass,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84875203128

We investigated the extent to which work-related factors influence (1) whether an individual decides to cycle to work, and (2) whether an individual cycles to work every day. It is anticipated that the office culture and colleagues' and employers' attitudes would significantly influence both decisions. These factors are expected to impact the provision of cycling facilities and financial compensation schemes in the workplace. We conducted an Internet survey in 4 Dutch municipalities, gathering data from over 4,000 respondents. The results suggest that the following factors increase the likelihood of being a commuter cyclist: having a positive attitude towards cycling; colleagues' expectations that an individual will cycle to work; the presence of bicycle storage inside; having access to clothes changing facilities; and needing a bicycle during office hours. The presence of facilities for other transport modes, an increase in the commute distance, and the need to transport goods, in turn, reduces the chance that an individual will cycle. Cycling frequency is negatively affected, meanwhile, by an increase in commute distance, a free public transport pass or car parking provided by the employer. These results indicate that an individual's working situation affects the commuting cycling behaviour. The findings also indicate that (partly) different variables influence an individual's decision to cycle to work, and their decision to cycle every day. © 2012 The Author(s).",Bicycle; Commuting; Mode choice; Work culture,Digital storage; Surveys; Traffic congestion; Commuting; Cycling frequencies; Financial compensation; Mode choice; Number of peoples; Physical activity levels; Positive attitude; Public transport; Bicycles; commuting; cycle transport; journey to work; parking; transportation mode; workplace; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84871974307

This article is aimed at a clarification of the dual use concept and its scope of application for the life sciences. Such a clarification would greatly facilitate the work of policymakers seeking to ensure security while avoiding undesirable interventions of government in the conduct of science. The article starts with an overview of the main developments in life sciences in relation to dual use. This is illustrated by discussions on synthetic biology and dual use. The findings lead to a reconsideration of the dual use concept. An area in need of further attention is to what extent threats and intentions should have impact on the definition of dual use. Possible threats are analyzed against the background of the phenomenon of securitization of health care and life sciences: considering these sectors of society in security terms. Some caveats that should be taken into account in a dual use policy are described. An acceptable, adequate and applicable definition of the dual use concept could help researchers, universities, companies and policy makers. Such a definition should build upon, but go beyond, the view developed in the influential Fink-report, which concentrates on the so-called 'experiments of concern', e. g. experiments that enhance the virulence of pathogens (National Research Council of the National Academies 2004) It will be argued that-in addition to these more technical aspects-a definition of dual use should include the aspect of threats and intentions. © 2011 The Author(s).",Biological weapons; Biosecurity; Dual use; Securitization; Threat,aggression; article; behavior; biomedicine; crime; ethics; government regulation; health care delivery; medical research; organization and management; policy; research; synthetic biology; terrorism; Aggression; Biological Science Disciplines; Biomedical Research; Crime; Delivery of Health Care; Government Regulation; Intention; Policy; Research; Security Measures; Synthetic Biology; Terrorism,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84870734602

In this paper we describe competence formation and competence needs in a case study of the Directorate General of Water Resources (DGWR) in the Ministry of Public Works in Indonesia. A framework is introduced for the water sector comprising three aggregate competences for technical issues, management, and governance, and a meta-competence for continuous learning and innovation. The four competences are further organised in a T-shaped competence profile. Though DGWR professionals have a firmly ""technical"" orientation, both surveys and interviews reveal a strong perceived requirement for other competences: in particular the learning meta-competence, as well as the aggregate competence for management. The aggregate competence for governance systematically scores lower. Further, a discrepancy appears to exist between the competences that staff perceive as needed in daily work, and those that can be acquired during post-graduate water education. <br><br> In both locally-based and international post-graduate water education, the aggregate competences for management as well as governance are reportedly addressed modestly, if at all. With low competence in these fields, it is difficult for professionals to communicate and collaborate effectively in a multidisciplinary way. As a result, the horizontal bar of the T-shaped profile remains weakly developed. In international post-graduate education, this is partially compensated by the attention to continuous learning and innovation. The exposure to a different culture and learning format is experienced as fundamentally formative. © 2012 Author(s).",,Continuous learning; Indonesia; Water sector; Aggregates; Public works; Water resources; Water supply; Education; drinking water; educational development; governance approach; innovation; learning; water management; water resource; Indonesia,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84868581128

Initiatives of public sector reform, commonly referred to as New Public Management (NPM), often failed to achieve the desired results and led to undesired outcomes. Hence, a new reform approach, referred to as Public Value Management (PVM), emerged to overcome these negative effects and to which the use of information technology (IT) is central. This paper investigates a t-government effort in the Netherlands to find whether it realizes the objectives of PVM. The findings of the case study show that t-government does not achieve these objectives. Instead of realizing a transformed organizational structure, t-government is found to be concerned with setting up governance among the different parties in a in network to allow for collaboration. Furthermore, the case study results show that to realize the outcomes of PVM, t-government needs to be accompanied by a professionalization of the work force and by making government processes more transparent to ensure public accountability. © 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",E-Government; New Public Management; Public Sector Reform; Public Value Management; T-Government; Transformational government,e-Government; New public management; Public sector; Public values; T-Government; Transformational government; Information technology; Government data processing,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865596075

Utilizing questionnaire survey data from a sample of airport employees in European Airports across the continent, we analyzed how both formal and informal sources of security information affect employee's decisions to comply with the security rules and directives. This led us to trace information network flows to assess its impact on the degree employees making security decisions comply or deviate with the prescribed security rules. The results of the multivariate analysis showed that security information obtained through formal and informal networks differentially determine if employees will comply or not with the rules. Information sources emanating from the informal network tends to encourage employees to be more flexible in their security decisions while formal sources lead them to be more rigid with complying with rules and protocols. These results suggest that alongside the formal administrative structure of airports, there exists a diverse and pervasiveness set of informal communications networks that are a potent factor in determining airport security levels. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Airports; Information Sources; Security Decisions; Social Networks,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865610285

Integrated service delivery (ISD) is a way to let networked service providers offer services to their clients by bundling selected services offered by each provider so that clients do not have to deal with each single provider anymore. Designing such a network is a complicated endeavor as independent organizations need to collaborate and should understand how their activities are dependent on each other. Communication of events is necessary to deal with unpredictable and complex processes in such a network. In contrast with conventional event-driven architecture and service-oriented architecture (SOA) approaches, the hybrid model of event-driven interactions and SOA offers the required flexibility to realize ISD. This flexibility is realized by integrating not only services but also the processes of the different service providers to supply such services. A design science approach has been applied resulting in a detailed and formalized design of an event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA). The EDSOA has been illustrated to show how ISD is realized with support of the architecture in a scenario concerning an application for a temporary residence permit by an immigrant. An evaluative workshop has been conducted which reflected that the following criteria are most important for successful organizational adoption of the EDSOA: expected usefulness, fit with organizational standards, use of trusted technology, and ease of maintenance. © 2012 The Author(s).",Design science; EDSOA; Integrated service delivery; Public/private service network; Web services,Complex Processes; Design science; Different services; EDSOA; Event-driven architectures; Flexible architectures; Hybrid model; Integrated service; Networked services; Organizational standards; Service network; Service provider; Design; Information services; Service oriented architecture (SOA); Web services; Network architecture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865603603

Life cycle assessment (LCA) has increasingly been used to assess the potential of these alternatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The popularity of LCA in the policy context puts its methodological issues into another perspective. This paper discusses how bio-electricity directives deal with the issue of allocation and shows its repercussions in the policy field. Methods: Multifunctionality has been a well-known problem since the early development of LCA and several methods have been suggested to deal with multifunctional processes. This paper starts with a discussion of the most common allocation methods. This discussion is followed by a description of bio-energy policy directives. The description shows the increasing importance of LCA in the policy context as well as the lack of consensus in the application of allocation methods. Methodological differences between bio-energy directives possibly lead to different assessments of bio-energy chains. To assess the differences due to methodological choices in bio-energy directives, this paper applies three different allocation methods to the same bio-electricity generation system. The differences in outcomes indicate the importance of solving the allocation issue for policy decision making. Results and discussion: The case study focuses on bio-electricity from rapeseed oil. To assess the influence of the choice of allocation in a policy directive, three allocation methods are applied: economic partitioning (on the basis of proceeds), physical partitioning (on the basis of energy content), and substitution (under two scenarios). The outcomes show that the climate change score is assessed quite differently; ranging from 0.293 kg to 0.604 kg CO 2 eq/kWh. It is argued that this uncertainty hampers the optimal use of LCA in the policy context. The aim of policy LCAs is different from the aim of LCAs for analysis. Therefore, it is argued that LCAs in the policy context will benefit from a new guideline based on robustness. Conclusions: The case study confirms that the choice of allocation method in policy directives has large influence on the outcomes of an LCA. With the growing popularity of LCA in policy directives, this paper recommends a new guideline for policy LCAs. The high priority of robustness in the policy context makes it an ideal starting point of this guideline. An accompanying dialog between practitioners and commissioners should further strengthen the use of LCA in policy directives. © 2012 The Author(s).",Allocation; Bio-electricity; LCA; Policy; Rapeseed; Renewable energy,carbon dioxide; rapeseed oil; article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental planning; life cycle assessment; priority journal; renewable energy; resource allocation; Brassica napus,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84865090779

We analyse the trade-off between the different Pareto-optimal solutions and discuss the results of that analysis.

A literature review reveals a serious problem from a management perspective. The problem is that many different supplier segmentation methods have been proposed in the last three decades, each of which uses different segmentation variables and hence results in different segments. An overarching supplier segmentation method, considering various segmentation variables, is lacking. Based on an extensive literature review, we have analysed the current methods and we conclude that the literature on supplier segmentation can be divided into three different schools of thoughts. By clearly identifying the deficiencies of the existing theory on supplier segmentation, we developed a new approach. As the basis for this new approach, we developed three requirements to make an overarching approach to supplier segmentation. Firstly, supplier segmentation should be based on their long-term potential, which we propose to assess in terms of supplier capabilities and willingness to cooperate. Secondly, other functional areas beyond purchasing have to be considered when segmenting suppliers. Thirdly, supplier segmentation should be viewed as a step in a longitudinal process that includes selecting suppliers, segmenting them, managing the relationship with them and actively developing their role over time. We illustrate the proposed approach by segmenting the suppliers of a company in the food industry. © 2012 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",buyer-supplier relationship; supplier development; supplier management; supplier segmentation; supplier selection; supply chain management (SCM),Buyer-supplier relationships; Supplier development; Supplier management; Supplier segmentation; Supplier selection; Mathematical models; Production engineering; Supply chain management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864969917

The three independent variables are project type (road, rail, and fixed link projects), project size (measured in terms of estimated costs) and the length of the project implementation phase. For Dutch projects, average cost overrun is 10.6% for rail, 18.6% for roads and 21.7% for fixed links. For project size, small Dutch projects have the largest average percentage cost overruns but in terms of total overrun, large projects have a larger share. The length of the implementation phase and especially the length of the pre-construction phase are important determinants of cost overruns in the Netherlands. With each additional year of pre-construction, percentage cost overrun increases by five percentage points. In contrast, the length of the construction phase has hardly any influence on cost overruns. This is an important contribution to current knowledge about cost overruns, because the period in which projects are most prone to cost overruns is narrowed down considerably, at least in the Netherlands. This means that to determine the causes and cures of overruns one should focus on the period. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost overruns; Ex-post studies; Infrastructure; The Netherlands,performance assessment; transaction cost; transportation infrastructure; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862575156

In the Netherlands, cost overruns are as common as cost underruns but because cost overruns are larger than cost underruns projects on average have a cost overrun of 16.5%. The focus on one country further enabled to consider cost overruns during different project development phases. It turned out that in the Netherlands the majority of the cost overrun occurs in the pre-construction phase (the period between the formal decision to build and the start of construction). The frequency as well as the magnitude of pre-construction cost overrun is significantly higher than in the construction phase. The used methodology of calculating cost overruns does however not take lock-in into account. This phenomenon shows that the real decision to build was taken much earlier in the decision-making process. Since estimated costs are usually lower during these earlier stages, the cost overruns based on this real decision to build are likely to be much higher. Cost overruns presented in studies are therefore often underestimated and the problem of cost overruns is much larger than we think. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.",Cost overruns; Infrastructure; Netherlands; Project phases; Transport,decision making; project management; transaction cost; transportation infrastructure; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84862274644

Moreover, when citizens participate in EIAs, they develop attitudes towards the project itself, and towards the broader policy. This paper addresses the complex relationship between participating in EIA studies and accepting policies. We first discuss what attitudes can develop towards a project, and how they may influence the perception of the broader policy sector and the attitude towards policy processes. We distinguish four attitudes and show they are present in a dike-relocation case in the Netherlands. We further show that different experiences in the EIA led to different project evaluations and this impacted stakeholders' attitudes to participation, projects and policy-making. We found four aspects of the EIA process of this project that partly explain the arisen difference in project attitudes. These aspects are important to consider in the design and management of participative EIAs. © 2012 Copyright IAIA.",EIA; project and policy acceptance; public participation,environmental impact assessment; local participation; policy making; project design; project management; stakeholder; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84863462987

Even less attention has been given to the inter-organizational setting. The aim of this paper is to better understand this relationship. Design/methodology/approach: The relationship between EA and project failure/success is investigated by - through a workshop - creating a retrospective view on the use of architectures in large and complex ICT-projects. Findings: Failure factors can be grouped in organization network, people, process, product and technology categories. The findings show that a disappointingly limited number of public sector development projects make sufficient use of architecture as a risk management instrument. Architectures should be considered both as a risk-mitigating instrument and as an organizational shaping routine to reduce project failure and manage risk in organization networks. Research limitations/implications: A single workshop with a limited number of participants was conducted. The findings need further refinement and generalization based on more empirical research investigating the relationship between architecture and project failure. Practical implications: Architecture should give explicit consideration to risk management and help to draw attention to this. Governance mechanisms need be defined to ensure that the organizations' members become aware of both architecture and risk management. Risk management and EA have similarities, as they are both an instrument and an organizational shaping routine. Originality/value: Governments collaborate more and more in organizational networks and for that reason often multiple organizations are involved in information system project developments.

This paper presents constructive conflict as a central design issue for stakeholder dialogue. This means that a dialogue entails the articulation of a diversity of perspectives and the confrontation of claims and ideas based on these perspectives. Building on three properties of diversity (variety, balance and disparity), the methodological implications of constructive conflict as a central design issue will be derived. These implications are structured according to three design steps: stakeholder identification and selection, articulation of perspectives and confrontation of claims and ideas. It is argued that social scientific methods are needed to support design of stakeholder dialogue.

This leads various scholars to the claim that engineers should explicitly take into account ethical considerations. They are at the cradle of new technological developments and can thereby influence the possible risks and benefits more directly than anybody else. I have argued elsewhere that emotions are an indispensable source of ethical insight into ethical aspects of risk. In this paper I will argue that this means that engineers should also include emotional reflection into their work.

When thinking about technology, ethics is often only mentioned as a constraint on developments, not as a source and spring of innovation. In this paper, we argue that ethics can be the source of technological development rather than just a constraint and technological progress can create moral progress rather than just moral problems. We show this by an analysis of how technology can contribute to the solution of so-called moral overload or moral dilemmas. Such dilemmas typically create a moral residue that is the basis of a second-order principle that tells us to reshape the world so that we can meet all our moral obligations. We can do so, among other things, through guided technological innovation. © 2011 The Author(s).",Engineering; Moral overload; Technological progress,article; engineering; ethics; human; morality; problem solving; technology; Engineering; Humans; Moral Obligations; Problem Solving; Technology,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84856719565

Designing simulation games are the result of creative thinking and planning, but often not the result of a rigorously applied design method. Design methods can be used to structure the creative process. The specific types of games we chose for studying design methods are simulation games focused on information-intensive domains, of which logistics management is an example. Our new design method takes into account the information intensiveness of the domain. The design method incorporates enterprise information management, simulation model design, and instructional design. The design method we propose uses ten steps in designing a simulation game: the first five for making a conceptual design and the final five for using the conceptual design as a basis for the simulation game. Iterative cycles are added to improve intermediate results. This paper discusses the design method and presents two different case studies. The first case study helped in developing the design method, while the second case study served for assessment and improvement. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.",design method; engineering simulation and visualization; game design; gaming simulation; instructional design,Design method; Engineering simulation; Game design; gaming simulation; instructional design; Conceptual design; Information management; Research; Visualization; Computer simulation,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84855175938

Thus, radical innovations often serve as the foundation for new technological systems, industries or domains and are seen to involve significant conceptual breakthroughs, through either luck or genius. The much more common incremental innovations are perceived as mere improvements to existing technologies. Decreasing returns from incremental innovation are understood to motivate a search for a new radical innovation to provide a platform for more incremental innovation. However, deeper study shows that the conceptual ""distance"" a radical breakthrough travels is far shorter than would initially appear. On closer inspection, several innovations with undoubtedly radical effects comprise several small inventive steps that appear self-evident, even logical, to the developers. This conundrum appears to stem from conflating a radical effect with a radical development. What's more, this view of radical innovation views inventions as isolated from the broader currents of technological development. An alternative view sees innovations as embedded in a co-evolutionary socio-technical landscape, where inventions develop in a technological environment and become building blocks for further inventions. Although only inventions adopted for use can be called innovations, ""inactive"" inventions can also serve as building blocks. In this view, (almost) all steps to innovation are incremental, but the system's self-organized criticality (SOC) allows spontaneous radical effects. This work explores the importance of an evolutionary and SOC view of invention and innovation through agent based models. We develop a simple model capable of simulating the build-out of technologies in a series of simulation experiments. Although all inventions develop incrementally, the model behaviour is expected to exhibit SOC so that some inventions trigger much higher rates of subsequent development than others. Thus, the results are expected to support an evolutionary view of technological development where a radical effect is a consequence of the entire interdependent landscape rather than of the radical development of a specific innovation. The model should be of interest to several research streams concerned with simulating and studying R&D activities. © 2012 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",Agent-based models; Incremental innovation; Radical innovation; Self-organized criticality; Technology adoption,,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84897141798

Especially in the design of bridges and terminals, the probability of ship collision is important. Researchers are looking for simulations that mimic ship behavior and estimate accident probabilities rather than using probabilistic accident models. AIS (Automatic Identification System) data forms a valuable basis for development of such simulation models. The data is a valuable asset for the validation and calibration of accident simulation models. Hence, a detailed analysis of AIS data is being undertaken as part of current research on ship collision simulations. Based on AIS data analysis, we developed a primary application of multi-agent simulation for ship traffic in the Yangtze River, which provides a realistic representation of the shipping traffic. Visual comparisons between AIS data and simulation data show comparable ship movements. More importantly, many different simulations show that the output of the simulation reproduces the behavior of real ships according to AIS data. Further down the road, ship failures will also be simulated, which results in a probability of ship accidents. Rather than the existing mathematical methods to estimate the risks of maritime accidents, multi-agent simulations provide a realistic ship behavior and all the details of ship movement. The model provides detailed information on how ships go wrong, and forms a useful tool in the design of waterways, design of bridges, and in traffic management. © 2012 The Authors.

The use of these open data can be supported and stimulated by providing considerable metadata (data about the data), including discovery, contextual and detailed metadata. In this paper we argue that metadata are key enablers for the effective use of Linked Open Data (LOD). We illustrate the potential of metadata by 1) presenting an overview of advantages and disadvantages of metadata derived from literature, 2) presenting metadata requirements for LOD architectures derived from literature, workshops and a questionnaire, 3) describing a LOD metadata architecture that meets the requirements and 4) showing examples of the application of this architecture in the ENGAGE project. The paper shows that using metadata with the appropriate metadata architecture can yield considerable benefits for LOD publication and use, including improving find ability, accessibility, storing, preservation, analysing, comparing, reproducing, finding inconsistencies, correct interpretation, visualizing, linking data, assessing and ranking the quality of data and avoiding unnecessary duplication of data.

Instead of handling all suppliers separately, segmentation yields a manageable number of segments, each of which requires a similar strategy. Standard methods of supplier segmentation have serious shortcomings: they often use a limited number of criteria and do not capture the complicated interaction between different supplier aspects. There is often little by way of data that can be used to apply more advanced statistical segmentation approaches. In this paper, we use two overarching dimensions to capture all available segmentation criteria: supplier capabilities and supplier willingness. We propose two multi-criteria approaches to assess the position of suppliers with regard to these dimensions and subsequently that outcome to identify segments. These multi-criteria approaches, a fuzzy rule-based system and a DEA-like linear programming model are applied to a real-world case to demonstrate how the results can be used in practice.

Crucial for acceptance of the supply chain visibility concept is trust in the reliability of the data. This depends on both the integrity of information (no data is altered illicitly) and integrity of the flow of goods (no goods are unknowingly added or taken away). The challenge is to determine how these concepts of integrity are interconnected. In this paper, we discuss control measures to ensure integrity of supply chain information and the related goods flow. Such controls consist of three components. First, only trusted traders take part. Second, technical control measures ensure internal consistency of the information system, i.e., the system maintains integrity constraints based on a model of the transactions taking place. Third, physical and organizational control measures mitigate the risk that events in the real world do not correspond to the reported transactions. The usefulness and adequacy of the approach is illustrated with two case studies: the use of electronic seals in the Smart-CM project, and the use of biometrics for authentication in the E-Link project at Schiphol Airport, the Netherlands. © 2012 Springer-Verlag.",integrity; supply chain visibility; virtual data pipeline,Airport security; Biometrics; Electronic document exchange; Information systems; International trade; Regulatory compliance; Technical presentations; Visibility; Control measures; Electronic seals; integrity; Integrity constraints; Internal consistency; Netherlands; Physical world; Schiphol airports; Supply chain visibility; Technical control; Three component; Virtual data; Supply chains,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84864687844

Public acceptance of these technologies is crucial for their successful introduction into society. Although various studies have investigated technology acceptance, most technology acceptance studies focused on a limited set of factors that can influence public acceptance, and were not based on a comprehensive framework including key factors influencing technology acceptance. This paper puts forward a comprehensive framework of energy technology acceptance, based on a review of psychological theories and on empirical technology acceptance studies. The framework aims to explain the intention to act in favor or against new sustainable energy technologies, which is assumed to be influenced by attitude, social norms, perceived behavioral control, and personal norm. In the framework, attitude is influenced by the perceived costs, risks and benefits, positive and negative feelings in response to the technology, trust, procedural fairness and distributive fairness. Personal norm is influenced by perceived costs, risks and benefits, outcome efficacy and awareness of adverse consequences of not accepting the new technology.

Firms, therefore, should make complex order acceptance decisions with regard to their organizational goals in an effective way. Models are called for to provide insight for decision-makers in developing proper strategies for order acceptance. This paper presents an agent-based model to support order acceptance decisions in a multi-plant enterprise, particularly incorporating buyer-seller negotiations. The negotiation process is conceptualized in three phases, pre-negotiation, negotiation, and post-negotiation, taking into account salient viewpoints on making order acceptance decisions. The conceptualization and the developed model not only provide valuable insights into the nature of negotiation in a supply chain setting, but also contribute to the understanding of strategy development for order acceptance. © 2011 IEEE.",agent-based modeling; buyer-seller negotiation; order acceptance; supply chain,Agent-based model; Agent-based modeling; Buyer-Seller negotiation; Decision makers; Developed model; Long term performance; Negotiation process; Order acceptance; Organizational goals; Strategy development; Three phasis; Computational methods; Cybernetics; Industry; Supply chains; Multi agent systems,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-83755195726

With a better understanding of the CO2 emissions, more effective solutions to reduce CO2 emissions by container terminals can be identified. The study provides insight into the processes of container handling and transshipment at the terminals and calculates the contribution of these processes to the CO2 emissions (or carbon footprint) of the container terminals.

Literature on reinforcement and displacement states that the use of new media depends on whether users are inclined to replace or reinforce their existing media use on a new device. This paper analyzes whether the importance that users attribute to using similar services on their mobile phone as on the fixed Internet can explain the intention to adopt mobile services. Specifically, we investigate if such fixed-mobile reinforcement attitude could mediate the impact of personal innovativeness and context-of-use on intention to adopt mobile services. We compare basic Internet services, entertainment services and transaction services. We find that especially the intention to adopt basic Internet services largely depends on the importance of using similar services in the mobile domain as on the fixed Internet. Several context-of-use predictors are partially or even fully mediated by our novel construct.

We focus on the experiences in several infrastructure-bound sectors: spatial planning and transport, ports, and energy.We conclude that the ROA maturity levels of these different sectors are quite different, and we ascribe these differences to the political setting, the institutional setting and the organisational flexibility of the sectors and their stakeholders.

Third, we perform a meta-analysis and we specify the direction of each factor on format dominance. This results in a framework that facilitates assessing the chances that an interface format achieves dominance. We demonstrate that this framework is more complete than previous frameworks.

To ensure their privacy and realize information security, controlling data access is paramount. However, limited research was found on issues that emerge when realizing data access control in inter-organizational collaboration. Security is typically achieved by implementing security patterns, which are proven technical solutions. This paper explores data control issues for realizing information security by looking at the application of security patterns in practice. By investigating a case study of inter-organizational collaboration in the Netherlands we explore the use of two security patterns that control access to information: Extended Role-Based Access Control (ERBAC) and Single Access Point/Check Point. We investigated whether those patterns were implemented in the right way and whether they were sufficient for guaranteeing access control. We found issues related to access control to be crucial in realizing information security, which can only be realized by implementing organizational arrangements in addition to technical solutions. Therefore, we recommend development of a framework for information security in interorganizational collaboration including technical and organizational aspects. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.",e-Government; Information Security; Inter-Organizational Collaboration; Security Patterns,Access points; Control access; Data access; Data access control; Data control; e-Government; Interorganizational collaboration; Multiple organizations; Netherlands; Organizational aspects; Public organizations; Public sector; Role-based Access Control; Security patterns; Service delivery; Technical solutions; E-governments; Extended role based access control; Interorganizational collaboration; Multiple organizations; Organizational aspects; Public organizations; Security patterns; Technical solutions; Government data processing; Security systems; Government data processing; Security of data; Access control; Access control,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80052762448

Modeling such kinds of organizational interactions requires a mechanism to differentiate interactive environments and elaborate regulations according to their characteristics. For this purpose, a context-aware inter-organizational modeling approach is proposed in this paper. The approach analyzes organizational interactions through three phases from abstract to concrete: (1) general specifications which describe organizations in terms of atomic roles with intellectual objectives, (2) contextual specifications which extend general specifications by applying contexts to derive composite roles with details on how to accomplish the objectives, and (3) operational specifications which construct a set of complete models of an inter-organizational collaboration by assembling contextual specifications according to the run-time environment.

Spoken language is the basis for telling stories. Collaborative audio-based storytelling uses the act of verbally telling stories in groups. In this paper, we explore how to utilize verbally told stories for informal knowledge management. To identify the requirements for an information system that supports collaborative audio-based storytelling, we review the body of knowledge in relation to storytelling and knowledge management. After reviewing the state of the art, we present the CASTing information system. CASTing (Collaborative Audio-based StoryTelling) addresses the identified requirements and supports a process for collaborative audio-based storytelling. CASTing consists of a client application which supports nomadic work as well as a web portal which aims at building a storytelling community. We present CASTing along our process for collecting, structuring, linking and using verbally told stories. We conclude with a report on first experiences as well as an outlook on future directions. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Collaboration; Knowledge management; Storytelling; Verbally told stories,,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051885773

To manage the quality of the knowledge a group generates, facilitators attend to, judge, and question the quality of the contributions a group makes, the decisions it makes and the commitments its members make toward achieving the group's goals. When facilitators or group members detect deficiencies in ideas, decisions, agreements, or artifacts, facilitators may need to intervene to support the group in improving the quality of their output, without disrupting the flow of the group process. In this paper we present a framework for quality assessment and a toolbox with flexible interventions that can be added to a collaborative process on the fly as soon as quality deficiencies are detected. The toolbox is a set of conditional adjustment interventions that a facilitator can add to other facilitation techniques so as to guard the quality of the group's intellectual products. The toolbox can also be used as a starting point for designing intelligent agents that support the automatic detection of quality deficiencies. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Collaboration engineering; Facilitation; Modifiers; Quality assurance; ThinkLets,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051883613

Since many evaluation reports on disaster response efforts have revealed instances of poor IQ, both academics and practitioners are in search of information architectures that assure IQ. This article focuses on the hurdles and opportunities for IQ assurance via information architectures. Drawing on two opposing coordination approaches, hierarchical versus netcentric, we suggest adopting a hybrid, information orchestration-based approach for assuring IQ. While hierarchical coordination approaches result in architectures dictating predefined information flows dependent on structures and procedures, netcentric information coordination emphasizes the need for individual self-synchronization driven by events. Even though both architectures have their strengths and weaknesses depending on several contingencies, both include characteristics that hamper IQ assurance for relief workers. Information orchestration offers the middle ground between hierarchical and netcentric approaches and defined as a heterarchical form of information coordination consisting of a specific set of roles and capabilities related to the collection, enrichment, and dissemination of high-quality information. Capabilities that need to be developed according to the information orchestration approach constitute a research agenda. © 2011 The Author(s).",Disaster management; Information quality; Netcentric orchestration; Public safety networks,Disaster management; Disaster response; Evaluation reports; Hierarchical coordination; High quality; Information architectures; Information coordination; Information flows; Information quality; Net-centric; Public safety; Relief workers; Research agenda; Self synchronization; Architecture; Disaster prevention; Information retrieval; Information science; Knowledge management; Quality assurance; Network architecture,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-80051665012

The objective of the paper is to understand motivation, technology and effects of on-line health companion contact in the Netherlands concerning chronic diseases (DBM, COPD, CHF, CRD, CMD). The On-line Health Companion Contact Model was created to frame the research process. An extensive on-line questionnaire was taken from patients with various chronic disorders and using on-line health companion contact to obtain quantitative and qualitative data. Obtaining information was found the key motivation for applying on-line health companion contact and several characteristics play a role in the selection to use a specific website, including: closed access; the topics discussed; the easy use; the type of users and a clear structure. Respondents prefer website facilitated by a forum or social networking site. Other factors are the possibility to share experiences with other patients, to find recognition and understanding and to meet new people. These positive aspects are of greater importance than the perceived barriers including privacy concerns, negative stories and whining other users and concerns regarding the quality of information.

In order to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of CE in organizational policy-making, it is important to have a systematic evaluation instrument.

In this debate, the measurement and valuation of nonfatal health outcomes have been defined as key issues. Our goal was to quantify and decompose international differences in health expectancy based on health-related quality of life (HRQoL). We focused on the impact of value set choice on cross-country variation.Methods: We calculated Quality Adjusted Life Expectancy (QALE) at age 20 for 15 countries in which EQ-5D population surveys had been conducted. We applied the Sullivan approach to combine the EQ-5D based HRQoL data with life tables from the Human Mortality Database. Mean HRQoL by country-gender-age was estimated using a parametric model. We used nonparametric bootstrap techniques to compute confidence intervals. QALE was then compared across the six country-specific time trade-off value sets that were available. Finally, three counterfactual estimates were generated in order to assess the contribution of mortality, health states and health-state values to cross-country differences in QALE.Results: QALE at age 20 ranged from 33 years in Armenia to almost 61 years in Japan, using the UK value set. The value sets of the other five countries generated different estimates, up to seven years higher. The relative impact of choosing a different value set differed across country-gender strata between 2% and 20%. In 50% of the country-gender strata the ranking changed by two or more positions across value sets. The decomposition demonstrated a varying impact of health states, health-state values, and mortality on QALE differences across countries.Conclusions: The choice of the value set in SMPH may seriously affect cross-country comparisons of health expectancy, even across populations of similar levels of wealth and education. In our opinion, it is essential to get more insight into the drivers of differences in health-state values across populations. This will enhance the usefulness of health-expectancy measures. © 2011 Heijink et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,age class; bootstrapping; confidence interval; database; decomposition analysis; education; environmental values; life expectancy; life table; mortality; public health; quality of life; trade-off; adult; article; Asia; calculation; data analysis; Europe; female; health status; human; life expectancy; major clinical study; male; mortality; New Zealand; North America; population research; priority journal; quality adjusted life expectancy; quality of life; Armenia; Japan; United Kingdom,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79959406120

In this paper, we emphasize that there is a need for such a method and the basis of the method is explained. This consists of the identification of possible life cycle related scenarios when trying to integrate services.

We identify the requirements to capture the value of information networks and indicate a possible theoretical ground to account for it. Based upon this, we propose a framework operationalized with data from Eurostat. Furthermore, we identify the added-value of our framework with a precise and comprehensive comparison with two state of the art reference frameworks. We demonstrate that our framework provides significant conceptual added-value and, more fundamentally, allows for traditional measures of economic value (e. g. productivity and growth), as well as for other measures of value (e. g. social and environmental).

Farmers' decision-making was mimicked in a three-layer hierarchical architecture of fuzzy inference systems, using data of 72 farms. The model includes three variables for family motives of diversification, six variables related to component integration, next to variables for the production factors and for farmers' appreciation of market prices and know-how on 10 components. To obtain a good classification rate of the less frequent activities, additional individual fine-tuning was necessary after general model calibration. To obtain the desired degree of sensitivity to each variable, it was necessary to use up to five linguistic values for some of the input and output variables in the intermediate hierarchical layers. Model's sensitivity to motivational variables determining diversification and integration was of the same magnitude as its sensitivity to market prices and farmers' know-how of the activities, but less than its sensitivity to labour, capital and land endowment. Modelling to support strategic decision-making seems too elaborate for individual farms, but FLM will be useful to integrate farmers' opinions in strategic decision-making at higher hierarchical levels. © 2010 The Author(s).",Agricultural systems; Decision-making; Hierarchical fuzzy models; Households; Motivations,Agricultural system; Classification rates; Component integration; Degree of sensitivity; Fuzzy inference systems; Fuzzy logic model; General model; Hierarchical architectures; Hierarchical fuzzy; Hierarchical level; Households; Input and outputs; Know-how; Linguistic values; Market price; Mekong Delta; Strategic decisions; Three-layer; Viet Nam; Farms; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy systems; Hierarchical systems; Motivation; Technology transfer; Decision making,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79952036447

Compliance to regulations fuels the added-value that business processes represent and prevents judiciary pursuits. Norm enforcement mechanisms are used to determine whether organizations have complied with the regulations or norms, which can be divided into mechanisms that are oriented towards direct control and mechanisms that are oriented towards self regulation. When designing a system to support agents in norm fulfillment and enforcement, the relation between norm enforcement mechanisms and the abstract values that are behind them should be explicitly incorporated in the development of the system. In this paper, a first step in the development of such a value-sensitive system is taken by formalizing the values of direct control and self regulation.

How important patient-centredness is in relation to effectiveness of fertility care has never been investigated. This study aimed to determine and compare the importance of patient-centredness, relative to pregnancy rates, to patients and physicians. Methods A discrete choice experiment (DCE) was designed. Participants had to choose between hypothetical fertility clinics differing in following attributes: travel time; pregnancy rate (effectiveness); physicians attitude; information on treatment; and continuity of physicians (the latter three represent patient-centredness). A total of 1378 patients and 268 physicians from eight Dutch and Belgian fertility clinics received the DCE-questionnaire. The attributes relative importance was analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Additionally, patients actual choice behaviour was investigated. Results In total, 925 patients and 227 physicians participated. Pregnancy rates were relatively more important to physicians. Patients assigned more value to patient-centredness (P< 0.001) and were willing to trade-off a higher pregnancy rate for patient-centredness than physicians recommended them to do (P< 0.05). For example, patients considered pregnancy rates 1.5 times as important as an interested physicians attitude, whereas physicians considered this 2.4 times as important (P< 0.001). The willingness to trade-off pregnancy rate for this attitude was 9.8 for patients and 6.3 for physicians (P< 0.001). A lack of patient-centredness was the most cited non-medical reason for changing fertility clinics. Conclusions Patients and physicians put considerable value on pregnancy rates. However, physicians significantly undervalue the importance of patient-centredness to patients. Clinics aiming to optimize the quality of their services should be aware of the substantial importance their patients assign to patient-centredness. © 2011 The Author.",discrete choice experiment; fertility care; patient preferences; patient-centredness; pregnancy rates,adult; article; doctor patient relation; female; health care quality; human; infertility therapy; major clinical study; male; patient care; patient decision making; patient education; patient preference; physician attitude; pregnancy rate; travel,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-79951563105

For this purpose GNR is conceptualized as a superordinate latent construct underlying particular manifestations. This conceptualization is empirically tested through estimation of a second-order factor model. Data from a community survey at Frankfurt Airport are used for this purpose (N = 2206). The data fit the hypothesized factor structure well and support the conceptualization of GNR as a superordinate construct. It is concluded that noise annoyance and a direct measure of general reaction to noise capture a large part of the negative feelings and emotions in response to aircraft noise but are unable to capture all relevant variance.

Large-scale complex systems like energy grids, air-ground traffic control systems and logistics systems are designed in multi-actor environments and hence require various perspectives (e.g. financial, operational, and environmental) to serve different actors. Although this is the case, current simulation based decision support environments lack the capability of covering multiple system perspectives at once and in different levels of details to provide better understanding of the systems. In this paper, the key challenges and preliminary design ideas are discussed to provide a multiresolution modeling capability.

One of the main challenges of e-government is to induce change in the structure of public organizations to realize its full potential. This paper investigates e-government induced change using two complementary theoretical lenses applied to an e-government case study. We use organization theories to explore aspects of organizational structure that may change when implementating e-government and structuration theory to investigate how these aspects are affected by human action within its social structure. This combination allows us to investigate the discrepancy between the ambitions of e-government induced change and the actual changes accomplished in practice. Our analysis shows that using these two frames gives us better insight into the thorny subject of e-government than using a single theory. Further research should look into how these theories can be used to deepen our knowledge of e-government. © 2010 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.,E-government; Multidisciplinary approach; Organization theory; Organizational change; Structuration theory,e-Government; Multi-disciplinary approach; Organization theory; Organizational change; Structuration Theory; E-governments; Multi-disciplinary approach; Organization theory; Organizational change; Structuration Theory; Management; Research; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Computers; Government data processing; Government data processing,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-78049343260

However, e-health is not always designed with the requirements of patient empowerment in mind. Drawing on evidence-based e-health studies, we propose directions for best practices to develop e-health that promotes patient empowerment. Methods: The concept of patient empowerment in the Dutch setting is discussed first. The prerequisites for patient empowerment are then described and translated into empowerment areas relevant to e-health. Materials: We reviewed Dutch e-health studies that provide insights into what works, and what does not, in e-health. Results: On the basis of the lessons learned from the studies, we propose directions for best practices to develop e-health that promotes patient empowerment. These directions cover various aspects, such as the design and implementation of e-health, its information content and usability, awareness, and acceptance. The studies also indicate the difficulty of establishing that e-health is really dedicated to patient empowerment. Conclusions: Despite the body of knowledge about patient empowerment, as well as the technological visibility of e-health, evidence for best practices in general and for patient empowerment in particular is scarce. We call for a more systematic evaluation of e-health for patient empowerment and more reliable evidence. Beyond the organizational and technical issues involved in e-health, there is also a need to demonstrate its practical benefits to patients.

It notes that privatisation is generally accompanied by tradeoffs between competing democratic values such as effectiveness, efficiency, accountability, and equity and explores the extent to which particular tradeoffs might be related to aspects of the design of the regimes in which they occur. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses a comparative case study analysis of two Australian and two Canadian privatised building control regimes. This comparison is based on semistructured interviews with key actors in the building and building control industries. Findings – Evidence of the expected tradeoffs between competing democratic values is found in the privatised regimes within the case study. Some of these might be explained in terms of the extent of private sector involvement (PSI) in a regime, or of the nature of the relationship between the public and the private sectors within it. However, not all tradeoffs are necessarily related to these characteristics. Overall, PSI deliver an increase in effectiveness and efficiency but at a particular cost of public accountability. A competitive, rather than a complementary, relationship between the private and public sectors in a privatised regime is also found to be more likely to generate problems related to the equity of the service being provided. Research limitations/implications – The case studies are explorative in nature and the research does not therefore claim empirical generalization, but instead provides illustrations of the impacts that might result from privatising building code enforcement. The paper is largely based on a series of interviews. The findings should be understood as the aggregated opinions of the interviewees. Practical implications – Based on the case study analysis, the paper draws important conclusions for policymakers in this area. It suggests that privatisation should be performed with the utmost care and highlights positive features of the regimes studied that might indicate some of the ingredients of a successful privatisation. These include providing private sector inspectors with the opportunity to specialize, confining PSI to assessment tasks, and ensuring that a complementary relationship exists between the private and public sectors within the privatised regime. Originality/value – The paper makes original contributes to existing literature on the impact of the “policy mix” on regulatory governance, and on the tradeoffs which result from the introduction of the private sector into regulatory governance. © 2010, Emerald Group Publishing Limited",Australia; Buildings; Canada; Privatization; Regulation,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-84986091960

Methods: We performed a discrete choice experiment among Dutch healthcare professionals (policy makers, HTA experts, advanced HTA students). In twenty-seven choice sets, we asked respondents to elect reimbursement of one of two different healthcare interventions, which represented unlabeled, curative treatments. Both treatments were incrementally compared with usual care. The results of the interventions were normal outputs of HTA studies with a societal perspective. Results were analyzed using a multinomial logistic regression model. Upon completion of the questionnaire, we discussed the exercise with policy makers. Results: Severity of disease, costs per quality-adjusted life-year gained, individual health gain, and the budget impact were the most decisive decision criteria. A program targeting more severe diseases increased the probability of reimbursement dramatically. Uncertainty related to cost-effectiveness was also important. Respondents preferred health gains that include quality of life improvements over extension of life without improved quality of life. Savings in productivity costs were not crucial in decision making, although these are to be included in Dutch reimbursement dossiers for new drugs. Regarding subgroups, we found that policy makers attached relatively more weight to disease severity than others but less to uncertainty. Conclusions: Dutch policy makers and other healthcare professionals seem to have reasonably well articulated preferences: six of seven attributes were significant. Disease severity, budget impact, and cost-effectiveness were very important. The results are comparable to international studies, but reveal a larger set of important decision criteria.

As new technologies threaten not just populations but species and biospheres, scientists should reassess their moral culpability when researching fields whose impact may be catastrophic. Looking at real-world examples such as smallpox research and the Australian ""mousepox trick"", and considering fictional or future technologies like Kurt Vonnegut's ""ice-nine"" from Cat's Cradle, and the ""grey goo"" scenario in nanotechnology, this paper suggests how ethical principles developed in biomedicine can be adjusted for science in general. An ""extended moral horizon"" may require looking not just to the effects of research on individual human subjects, but also to effects on humanity as a whole. Moreover, a crude utilitarian calculus can help scientists make moral decisions about which technologies to pursue and disseminate when catastrophes may result. Finally, institutions should be devised to teach these moral principles to scientists, and require moral education for future funding. © The Author(s) 2009.",Dangerous technology; Duty of restraint; Moral responsibility; Research ethics; Scientific ethics,article; bioethics; biological warfare; decision making; ethical theory; ethics; financial management; forecasting; genetic engineering; genetics; human; information dissemination; medical ethics; medical research; morality; practice guideline; professional standard; risk assessment; science; Smallpox virus; Bioethics; Biomedical Research; Bioterrorism; Codes of Ethics; Decision Making; Double Effect Principle; Ethical Theory; Forecasting; Genetic Engineering; Guidelines as Topic; Humans; Information Dissemination; Moral Obligations; Principle-Based Ethics; Professional Role; Research Support as Topic; Risk Assessment; Science; Variola virus,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949295359

Usually, results are controlled for socio-economic differences and sometimes socio-psychological differences among respondents. However, these studies do not mention why after all a relationship should exist between travel behaviour and spatial, socio-economic and personality characteristics. Answering this query involves combining and linking theories stemming from transport geography (e.g. time geography, activity-based approach) and social psychology (e.g. Theory of Planned Behaviour, Theory of Repeated Behaviour). Using key-variables from these theories, this paper aims to develop a conceptual model for travel behaviour. Comparable to customary theories in transport geography, this conceptual model considers travel behaviour as derived from locational behaviour and activity behaviour. But the conceptual model adds concepts such as 'lifestyle', 'perceptions', 'attitudes' and 'preferences' which indirectly influence travel behaviour. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,lifestyle; modeling; perception; preference behavior; psychology; travel behavior,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-76549127909

In previous works, the resulting DEA score is regressed on environmental factors via a Tobit approach. Previously, these approaches have been used (Simar and Wilson, J Prod Anal 7(1):63-80, 2000) but later these authors (Simar and Wilson 2007) demonstrated that bias is incurred since the efficiency score is a point estimate without a probability distribution around it that is required by the Tobit methodology. In this paper we use the Simar and Wilson bootstrapping techniques in order to obtain more efficient estimates of the environmental effects.

To that end, the lanes of the Bornholmstraat (an entry / exit street near the Euroborg Soccer Stadium in Groningen) were reversed in one, outward-bound direction after a selected FC Groningen soccer match. The coincidental participants received a short questionnaire that contained a few questions concerning their behavior, opinions and feelings about the evacuation. To maximize the response rate a bonus was announced; if they returned the questionnaire, it gave them a chance of winning VIP tickets for a FC Groningen match.

They were not created at the current global scale at once but have slowly evolved from simple local systems through many social and technical decisions. If we are to understand them and manage them sustainably, we need to capture their full diversity and adaptivity in models that respect Ashby's law of requisite variety. Models of evolving complex systems must themselves be evolving complex systems that cannot be created from scratch but must be grown from simple to complex. This paper presents a sociotechnical evolutionary modelling process for creating evolving and complex Agent-Based Models (ABMs) for understanding the evolution of large-scale sociotechnical systems such as infrastructures. It involves the continuous coevolution and improvement of a social process for model specification, the technical design of a modular simulation engine, the encoding of formalised knowledge and the collection of relevant facts. In the paper, we introduce the process design, the requirements for guiding the evolution of the modelling process and illustrate the process for ABM development by showing a series of ever more complex models.

Lock-in can occur both at the decision-making level (before the decision to build) and at the project level (after the decision to build) and can influence the extent of overruns in two ways. The first involves the 'methodology' of calculating cost overruns according to the 'formal decision to build'. Due to lock-in, however, the 'real decision to build' is made much earlier in the decision-making process and the costs estimated at that stage are often much lower than those that are estimated at a later stage in the decision-making process, thus increasing cost overruns. The second way that lock-in can affect cost overruns is through 'practice'. Although decisions about the project (design and implementation) need to be made, lock-in can lead to inefficient decisions that involve higher costs. Sunk costs (in terms of both time and money), the need for justification, escalating commitment, and inflexibility and the closure of alternatives are indicators of lock-in. Two case studies, of the Betuweroute and the High Speed Link-South projects in the Netherlands, demonstrate the presence of lock-in and its influence on the extent of cost overruns at both the decision-making and project levels. This suggests that recognition of lock-in as an explanation for cost overruns contributes significantly to the understanding of the inadequate planning process of projects and allows development of more appropriate means. © 2010 Pion Ltd and its Licensors.",,cost-benefit analysis; decision making; project assessment; transportation development; transportation infrastructure; transportation planning; urban transport; Netherlands,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77958087569

However, in this article we focus on the 'subjective' aspect of scale preferences in water governance. We apply an adapted version of the Integrated Scale Hierarchy for Rivers to determine the degree of fit between the scale preferences of the actors involved in a Dutch case study and the scale requirements of the innovative river management concept. This allows us to understand which riverine processes and characteristics are regarded as important by the different actors and to identify mismatches in scale perspectives as they manifest themselves in water management practice. We discover that inflexibility in scale use on the part of the involved actors places bounds on the design and quality of interventions and demonstrate that a more flexible use of scales in the design phase of a river management intervention has the potential to lead to more effective solutions. © 2010 The Author(s).",Cyclic floodplain rejuvenation; Flexible scale use; Hydrodynamic modelling; Integrated scale hierarchy; Multi actor systems; Pilot project; River management; Scale preferences; Water governance,Water management; Flexible scale use; Flood plains; Hydrodynamic modelling; Integrated scale hierarchy; Multi-actor systems; Pilot projects; River management; Scale preferences; Water governance; Rivers; governance approach; hydrodynamics; legislative implementation; river management; water management; water planning; water resource; engineering; environmental economics; environmental management; environmental planning; flooding; floodplain; geomorphology; hydrology; Netherlands; review; river basin; river ecosystem; water management; water supply,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77955550730

For this purpose, a panel model was estimated within a structural equation modeling approach. Data were gathered from two surveys conducted in April 2006 and April 2008, respectively, among the same residents living within the 45 Level day-evening-night contour of Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, the largest airport in the Netherlands (n=250). A surprising result is that none of the paths from the psychological factors to aircraft noise annoyance were found to be significant. Yet 2 effects were significant the other way around: (1) from 'aircraft noise annoyance' to 'concern about the negative health effects of noise' and (2) from 'aircraft noise annoyance' to 'belief that noise can be prevented.' Hence aircraft noise annoyance measured at time 1 contained information that can effectively explain changes in these 2 variables at time 2, while controlling for their previous values. Secondary results show that (1) aircraft noise annoyance is very stable through time and (2) that changes in aircraft noise annoyance and the identified psychological factors are correlated.",Aircraft noise annoyance; Causal predominance; Panel model; Social-psychological factors,"adaptive behavior; aircraft; article; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; epidemiology; female; hearing; human; information processing; male; mental stress; middle aged; Netherlands; questionnaire; statistical model; statistics; traffic noise; Adaptation, Psychological; Aircraft; Auditory Perception; Causality; Data Collection; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Netherlands; Noise, Transportation; Questionnaires; Statistics as Topic; Stress, Psychological",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77949544583

In study 1, the prevalence of mobile phone use while cycling was assessed. In Groningen 2.2% of cyclists were observed talking on their phone and 0.6% were text messaging or entering a phone number. In study 2, accident-involved cyclists responded to a questionnaire. Only 0.5% stated that they were using their phone at the time of the accident. In study 3, participants used a phone while cycling. The content of the conversation was manipulated and participants also had to enter a text message. Data were compared with just cycling and cycling while listening to music. Telephoning coincided with reduced speed, reduced peripheral vision performance and increased risk and mental effort ratings. Text messaging had the largest negative impact on cycling performance. Higher mental workload and lower speed may account for the relatively low number of people calling involved in accidents. Statement of Relevance: Although perhaps mainly restricted to flat countries with a large proportion of cyclists, mobile phone use while cycling has increased and may be a threat to traffic safety, similar to phone use while driving a car.

In serious games for ill-defined problem domains such as infrastructures and markets, students often interact with preconceived agents at an operational level. We hypothesize however that students could discover more about a domain's complexity at a strategic level by building and testing their own delegate agents. Testing this requires an environment where students and teachers can construct agents at their own level of expertise with recent modeling technologies. For instance, students may create agents not just directly, by building or modifying comprehensive agent models with visual programming languages, but also indirectly, by shaping agent behavior as it evolves in user-defined training scenarios or by enacting example behavior which agents learn to imitate. We propose a serious game concept that combines such modeling methods within a single intelligent simulation platform so that it becomes a low-threshold interface for continuous knowledge exchange and gain between teachers, students and agents. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",,Agent behavior; Agent model; Knowledge exchange; Low thresholds; Modeling method; Modeling technology; Operational level; Problem domain; Serious games; Simulation platform; Strategic level; Training scenario; Visual programming languages; College buildings; Computer programming; Knowledge management; Simulators; Students; Teaching; Intelligent agents,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-72449147179

Among the various modelling paradigms, equation-based models and agent-based models are widely used to develop dynamic models of systems. Which is the most appropriate modelling paradigm for a supply chain? In this paper, we seek to address this important question through a well-structured benchmarking process. First, we demonstrate that in the space of models, 'equations' and 'agents' are concepts of a different order, the former referring to the system description elements in the model while the latter emphasises the model elements. Thus conceptually, the two paradigms are not mutually exclusive. Next, in a case study different dynamic models of an oil refinery supply chain are developed, using different tools and approaches. By performing detailed experiments with two different models, it is demonstrated that the models are equivalent when compared using model definition, numerical results and recommended decisions. However, the modelling process itself is different and results in different model structures. By analysing the effort required to expand the models, allowing new scenarios to be tested, and re-use of model components, we identify the strengths of the two paradigms in the context of supply chain modelling. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

In this article, a social approach for noise annoyance is proposed. The idea that aircraft noise is meaningful to people within a socially produced discourse is assumed and tested. More particularly, it is expected that the noise policy discourse influences people's assessment of aircraft noise. To this end, Q-methodology is used, which, to the best of the authors' knowledge, has not been used for aircraft noise annoyance so far. Through factor analysis five distinct frames are revealed: ""Long live aviation!,"" ""aviation: an ecological threat,"" ""aviation and the environment: a solvable problem,"" ""aircraft noise: not a problem,"" and ""aviation: a local problem."" It is shown that the former three frames are clearly related to the policy discourse. Based on this observation it is argued that policy making is a possible mechanism through which the sound of aircraft is turned into annoyance.

They allow easier access and integration of information that is collected by different groups. Ontologies are currently used in the biomedical sciences, geography, and law. A Biomedical Ethics Ontology (BMEO) would benefit members of ethics committees who deal with protocols and consent forms spanning numerous fields of inquiry. There already exists the Ontology for Biomedical Investigations (OBI); the proposed BMEO would interoperate with OBI, creating a powerful information tool. We define a domain ontology and begin to construct a BMEO, focused on the process of evaluating human research protocols. Finally, we show how our BMEO can have practical applications for ethics committees.

Over time, this development may pose a threat to the reliability and efficiency of the Dutch electricity balancing market. We investigated possible changes to the design of the Dutch balancing market that can maintain or even improve upon its current operational performance level. The first step of the research was an analysis of the existing Dutch balancing market. It consists of three main instruments: programme responsibility, the single buyer market for regulating and reserve power (RRP), and imbalance settlement. The balancing market currently functions satisfactorily. Subsequently, the effects of large-scale development of microgeneration in the Netherlands were evaluated with a qualitative scenario analysis. Four microgeneration scenarios and two methods for allocating the household electricity consumption and generation were considered. The four scenarios concerned large-scale penetration of PV, heat-led micro CHP, electricity-led micro CHP operated by the household consumer, and electricity-led micro CHP operated by the supply company. The last scenario was found to have the strongest positive net effect. Finally, six design options were identified for improving the Dutch balancing market design in case the share of microgeneration would increase substantially. Of these six options, adjusting the profile methodology and the regulation of smart meters are no-regret options that can be implemented immediately. The attractiveness of the other options depends upon the microgeneration portfolio that emerges, the manageability of large metering data flows, and the nature of the technical effects of large-scale microgeneration penetration. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

As part of the development of the survey instrument that was used in this study, we examined whether visual images (such as photographs) should be included, since they may clarify particular attributes (e.g., architectural style) and make the choice task more realistic for the respondents. However, images may disturb the results as respondents may evaluate accidental details on the photographs such as the color of the window frames. This paper presents the results of two subsequent pilot studies on the impact of including images in a web-based questionnaire. In the first study, eight dwelling profiles were presented in three different ways (""text only"", ""text and color photo"" and ""text and black-and-white impression"") to 28 respondents. In the second study two different instruments were used: one with written information and directly shown photo-collages; the other with written information and photo-collages on request only. Both studies showed that the inclusion of images led to a number of differences between the results obtained with the various presentation methods. These differences may be explained by accidental details on the images. Furthermore, dwelling characteristics appear to be more important to the respondents' overall evaluation of a dwelling when shown with photos than when presented in written format. However, since including images also has a substantial number of benefits, it may not be advisable to leave out images completely from the measurement task. Should images be included in a survey instrument, it is of utmost importance to make sure that all potentially disturbing details are cleared away. Furthermore, it may be better to show a collage of pictures than only one in order to decrease the specific impact of accidental details. © The Author(s) 2009.",Conjoint measurement; Housing preferences; Verbal presentation format; Visual presentation format,housing conditions; housing project; measurement method; photograph; visualization; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; Western Europe,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-68549118818

Elderly drivers suffer from reduced information processing speed and capacity, and in general effectively compensate for this by taking more time. However, this strategy, regulating task demands by slowing down will make merging into motorway traffic actually more difficult. In an experiment performed in a driving simulator, young and elderly drivers merged into motorway traffic. Driver behaviour and mental workload were studied while the following factors were manipulated: type of traffic and density of Heavy Goods Vehicles on the main road, the length of the acceleration lane, presence of a slowly driving lead car, and presence of a driver support system that encouraged the drivers to speed up if their speed was too low. Results show that the effects of an increased number of Heavy Goods Vehicles on the main road were not more adverse for elderly than for the young participants, with the exception that elderly drivers merged at a lower speed. This lower speed could make the manoeuvre more risky in real traffic. The support system and an extended acceleration lane facilitated merging, while a slowly driving lead car impeded completion of the manoeuvre. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

This paper addresses the question what explains such phenomena, with particular emphasis on, and reference to, collaborative policymaking settings in the Netherlands. We have elaborated the concept of 'frames' and 'framing' to structure and analyze the function of maps in the context of deliberative policymaking. With help of discourse analysis, a method adopted from the policy sciences, we have observed ongoing multi-actor processes and focused on discussions around maps in several case studies. From the observations of both the maps themselves and the discussions and actions with the maps, we have interpreted the meaning and frames represented 'in' the map images, as well as the various perspectives of actors 'on' the collaborative use of the map. We have conceptualized three fundamentally different perspectives or frames on the function of maps in the decision-making process. The cross-frame debate over maps is illustrated with the recollection of one particular map-making example. We conclude that the conflicts observed in a number of case studies can be adequately explained with help of the three identified frames, and provide some recommendations for the profession of mapping. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Service composition is not a trivial endeavor and several composition methods exist. Yet, these methods are hardly adopted by the field, as they need a set of well-defined and well-described services and are not able to deal with incomplete information and unambiguous descriptions. Furthermore, these methods are not able to deal with situations in which stakeholders have different requirements and need to negotiate with each other about the selection and performance of services. In this paper we present a service composition method and evaluate this method using a quasi-experimental design. The method is aimed at dealing with a set of heterogeneous services provided by stakeholders with different and sometimes even opposing requirements. We found that our composition method helps to create an overview of services and their attributes and enables better communication between stakeholders. A recommendation for further research is to integrate semantic and multi-actor composition methods. © 2009 IEEE.",,Composition methods; Experimental designs; Heterogeneous services; Incomplete informations; New systems; Public networks; Service composition methods; Service compositions; Information theory,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-63349106715

Their use varies over time, and a large number of individuals use them for different purposes. The basic digital government infrastructure has evolved over time and the development towards the next generation of digital government infrastructure (NGI) is under development.

Looking at the current literature on behaviour constraints and multi-agent (software) systems (MAS), one can distinguish various topics. The first topic concerns the analysis of various forms of restraint and their basis. This topic is at the core of moral philosophy. The second topic concerns the formalized specification of, and the reasoning about the constraints. The research on this topic focuses predominantly on the use of logic, mostly modal logic, and defeasible logic. The last topic is the MAS and implementation related topic of designing a working system in which there are rules that can be enforced and deviant behaviour be detected. Here we argue that all three topics need addressing and strong integration. The moral philosophical analysis is needed to provide a detailed conceptualization of the various forms of behaviour constraint and direction. This analysis goes beyond what is usual in the more technical/design focus. The (modal) logic provides the rigour required to ultimately allow implementation. The implementation itself is the ultimate objective. We outline the three components and demonstrate how they can be integrated. We observe here that we do not intend, or claim, that this moral reasoning is on par with human moral reasoning. Our claim is that the analysis of human moral reasoning may provide a useful model for constraining software agent behaviour. And, as equally important, it is recognizable by humans which is an important characteristic when it comes to 'human-artificial agent' interaction. Recognizing and understanding the precise basis for the behaviour constraint in the artificial entity will make the agent more trustful which, in its turn, will facilitate the acceptance of the use of and the interaction with artificial agents. © The Author(s) 2009.",BDI; Deontic constraints; Modal logic; Morality; Software agents; Trust,Agricultural robots; Behavioral research; Computer circuits; Formal logic; Modal analysis; Multi agent systems; Philosophical aspects; Social robots; Software agents; Analysis of various; Artificial agents; Autonomous software agents; Deontic constraints; Formalized specifications; Modal logic; Morality; Trust; Autonomous agents,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-77951173039

This assessment is performed by a) comparing the alternatives represented by each world and b) exploring the timeline of each world by selecting specific time instants.

Firstly, we distinguish different types of formal models which may be developed, ranging from models that focus on (bio)physical mechanisms to models which also include the actors involved in the utilisation of the resource and the social mechanisms that co-determine actor behaviour. Secondly, we consider what different modes of stakeholder participation entail for model construction and use. Finally, we propose six different purposes for a modelling exercise (clarify arguments and values, research and analyse, design and recommend, provide strategic advice, mediate, and democratise), and highlight conditions that affect the appropriateness of stakeholder participation for each purpose. The framework does not provide a straightforward recipe for the selection of participatory modelling methods, but we expect that the systematic reflection it affords will help analysts to make appropriate choices while designing a modelling exercise.",Formal models; Model typology; Natural resource management; Participatory methods; Stakeholders,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-57249094266

Technology is moving toward a situation in which automated energy management systems could control domestic energy generation, storage, and consumption. In previous work we have proposed a controller based on model predictive control for controlling an individual household using a micro combined heat and power plant in combination with heat and electricity storages. Although the controller provides adequate performance in computer simulations, the computational time required to determine which actions to take can be significant, due to the precise predictions made over a long prediction horizon. In this paper we propose to make the computations less time consuming by coarsening the quality of the predictions made over the prediction horizon by decreasing their time resolution.

This is also the remit of the main HTA program in the Netherlands. The aims of this study were to assess whether the results of this program have led to such improvements and to analyze how best to assess the impact from health research. Methods: We assessed the impact of individual HTA projects by adapting the ""payback framework"" developed in the United Kingdom. We conducted dossier reviews and sent a survey to principal investigators of forty-three projects awarded between 2000 and 2003. We then provided an overview of documented output and outcome that was assessed by ten HTA experts using a scoring method. Finally, we conducted five case studies using information from additional dossier review and semistructured key informant interviews. Results: The findings confirm that the payback framework is a useful approach to assess the impact of HTA projects. We identified over 101 peer reviewed papers, more than twenty-five PhDs, citations of research in guidelines (six projects), and implementation of new treatment strategies (eleven projects). The case studies provided greater depth and understanding about the levels of impact that arise and why and how they have been achieved. Conclusions: It is generally too early to determine whether the HTA program led to actual changes in healthcare policy and practice. However, the results can be used as a baseline measurement for future evaluation and can help funding organizations or HTA agencies consider how to assess impact, possibly routinely. This, in turn, could help inform research strategies and justify expenditure for health research.

The closed fuel cycle improve sustainability in terms of the supply certainty of uranium and involves less long-term radiological risks and proliferation concerns. However, it compromises short-term public health and safety and security, due to the separation of plutonium. The trade-offs in nuclear energy are reducible to a chief trade-off between the present and the future. To what extent should we take care of our produced nuclear waste and to what extent should we accept additional risks to the present generation, in order to diminish the exposure of future generation to those risks?

Their effects are generally measured in terms of intended outcomes. This article argues for the use of additional, more general measures to obtain a more complete impression of the effects of ICT-tools. The first study presented in this article shows why tools should not only be studied in terms of their specific intended outcomes, but also in terms of their effects on working memory, and the cognitive mechanisms needed to achieve the intended outcomes. The second study uses cognitive load measurements and stimulated recall interviews to obtain a more comprehensive view of the effects of learning tools.

Box 5015, 2600 GA Delft, Netherlands","This article proposes a framework for categorizing possible interrelations between technological and institutional change and applies this framework to the case of the restructuring of the electricity sector. It is argued that there is a need for coherence between institutions and technological practice, so as to safeguard the satisfactory functioning of electricity infrastructure. The identification of possible incoherences between institutions and technological practice allows for a better understanding of the potential drivers for change and the evolutionary processes of which they may be part. This article attempts to elaborate the nature of this co-evolution in somewhat more detail, using specific levels of analysis that are exemplified in a four-level model. In the case of the restructuring of the electricity sector, the institutional framework has changed from a public utility-oriented, towards a market-oriented system. However, the technological practice remained unchanged: A system-oriented approach that relies on centralized planning, control and operation. This discrepancy between institutions and technological practice leads to significant frictions in the functioning of the electricity sector, but it also offers opportunities for innovation. In order to make liberalization a success, it might be necessary to stimulate certain technical developments (i.e. distributed generation and intelligent networks). © The Author 2008.

Participants drove in a driving simulator in a total of 12 conditions; twice in each of two weather conditions and in three traffic conditions. The weather conditions were clear weather and foggy weather. The traffic conditions were without HGVs (i.e. only private cars), the current mix of HGVs and private cars, and a condition with a 70% increase of HGVs leading to an HGV column in the slow lane. The focus of the study was on assessing effects on behaviour and mental workload during filtering into traffic, and during exiting from the motorway. During the experiment driving performance was registered, behaviour was observed, self reports were collected, and the participant's heart rate was recorded. The results showed that directly after filtering into traffic the variation in driving speed increased and the minimum time headway decreased with an increase in the proportion of HGVs. Joining motorway traffic was considered to involve greater effort and risk in the condition with a column of HGVs. The effects of the conditions on heart rate are less clear, although the moment when the participants joined the traffic is clearly visible. The effects of weather conditions were limited, drivers adapting their driving behaviour in adverse weather by reducing speed. To exit the motorway is not a difficult manoeuvre. For that reason the lane change from the left hand to the right hand lane that preceded the exit was analysed. Although increased mental effort was reported and the lane change was visible in the heart rate record, no critical changes as a result of increase in proportion of HGVs were found for this manoeuvre. However, in the condition with a column of HGVs, the exit that had to be taken was most frequently missed as HGVs obstructed the view of the exit signs. It is concluded that an increase in HGVs will make merging into traffic more mentally demanding and will decrease safety margins. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The central aim is to inquire into how especially the development of high-speed rail and light rail links will affect European cities. The analyses are carried out with special attention given to the broader institutional environment of the railway system, including the shift toward privatised railway companies, internationalisation, the occurrence of market and government failures in land markets, and private-public partnerships in the development of railway station areas. The essence of the plans to invest in railway stations is that railway stations are not considered merely as nodes where people transfer from one vehicle to another, but also as places where spatial concentrations of high value activity are recognised as having a positive impact on cities. The development of real estate near stations is increasingly seen as a negotiation process in which both public and private actors play certain roles to revitalise central urban areas. © 2008 Physica-Verlag Heidelberg.

The network formed by households generating electricity with μCHP units and the facilitating energy supplier can be regarded as an electricity production system, analogous to a (flexible) manufacturing system. Next, the system boundary is extended by allowing the trade of electricity between networks of households and their supplier. A methodology for designing an agent-based system for manufacturing control is applied to both cases, resulting in a conceptual design for a control system for the energy infrastructure. Because of the analogy between production systems and infrastructures process systems engineering (PSE) approaches for optimisation and control can be applied to infrastructure system operations. At the same time we believe research on socio-technical infrastructure systems will be a valuable contribution to PSE management strategies. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For an individual household using a micro combined heat and power (μCHP) plant in combination with heat and electricity storages the controller determines what the actions are that minimize the operational costs of fulfilling residential electricity and heat requirements subject to operational constraints.

Research has shown that, for collaborative learning to be more effective than individual learning, individual learners have to achieve a sufficiently common cognitive frame of reference, or common ground. This common ground does not appear by itself, but rather often needs to be negotiated. This negotiation is seen as an important aspect of collaborative learning. This article presents a study with NTool, an ICT-tool to support the negotiation of common ground. NTool supports learners in making their individual perspectives explicit to others so that common ground can be negotiated. Two versions of the tool differing in the extent to which users were coerced into adhering to embedded support principles were used in a secondary vocational education setting. Coercion, as expected, increased negotiation of common ground in both settings. However, results were contradictory with regard to the extent to which common ground was achieved. Overall, it can be concluded that NTool and its underlying framework affect negotiation of common ground, and that adding some coercion increases this effect. However, when learners have no prior experience in collaborative complex problem-solving, NTool may only affect surface aspects of communication. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Coercion; Common ground; Complex problem-solving; ICT-tools; Negotiation; Secondary vocational education,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-35148845030

In this system, hubs are one of the key elements that function as transferring points of freight between different modes. The location of hubs is one of the most crucial success factors in intermodal freight transportation and needs to be considered very carefully as it has direct and indirect impacts on different stakeholders including investors, policy makers, infrastructure providers, hub operators, hub users, and the community. There have been several attempts to evaluate intermodal freight hub location decisions by using conventional multi-objective evaluation models. Only a few studies take community's benefits into account next to the costs and it is difficult to assess the relationship between system level performance and the prefered solution for individual actors. This paper aims at developing an integral model for the evaluation of road-rail intermodal freight hub location decisions. The model comprises five dominant types of agents namely, hub operators, terminal operators, infrastructure providers, hub users, and communities. An agent based modeling approach is introduced to allow negotiation to happen in order to achieve a global objective. The paper outlines the methodology to be used. It presents a conceptual design and an illustrative case study for an agent based model for the decision making process for planning the location of intermodal freight hubs. © 2007 IEEE.",Agent-based model; Decision making; Intermodal freight hub; Ontology; Socio-technical system,Conceptual design; Decision making; Location; Mathematical models; Multiobjective optimization; Ontology; Agent based models; Infrastructure providers; Intermodal freight hub; Socio-technical systems; Freight transportation,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34748831010

We are on a track to ecological and resource collapse if actions are not taken soon. Technology will have to play a key role in the process of changing industrial society. But innovation has to be embedded in social and organizational innovation. We need sociotechnical change. Environmentally conscious design has been practiced in engineering design for more than a decade. Its merits are sometimes blamed as futile, as the world has not witnessed a significant contribution to the solution of the larger (global) problems. This paper first sketches a scheme of the various levels of technological change, ranging from: (1) incremental optimizations of single artifacts, to (2) major change of artifacts, (3) systems change, and (4) technological transitions (involving changes in production and consumption). It outlines the stakeholders involved in these types of innovations and the parties that could orchestrate the innovation process. In this paper, It is argued that the most encompassing level of technological innovation, the level of transition, is crucial for achieving long-term sustainable development, as it has the largest potential for improvement. However, transition is not very well manageable. The paper contains a review of the literature regarding the occurrence of technological transitions. After a transition has occurred, the new system is often not efficient. Its gains in terms of diminished resource consumption or pollution have to be enlarged by less encompassing innovation strategies, such as systems innovations and product optimization. Transitions for sustainable development are often impossible, as the new systems have to compete with fully developed and optimized systems that have far advanced at the learning curve, i.e., are optimized by various systems and incremental innovations. Less encompassing levels of innovation, even those that aim at more sustainability, can counteract transitions that have more potential for sustainable development by improving the competing (unsustainable) technology. The paper will give several examples of this dilemma and some guidelines for developing government policies as well as corporate strategies. On the policy level, it is argued that it is especially important to develop (scope for) market niches for new sustainable systems and products as they create scope for experiments that could lead to transitions. © Integrated Research System for Sustainability Science and Springer 2007.",Backcasting; Innovation; Plastics; Scenario; Technology,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34748821844

The design and preparation of a collaboration process is an important facilitation task. Although there is a significant body of knowledge about the effects of facilitation, there is a dearth of knowledge about the ways in which facilitators design collaboration processes. Increased understanding in this area will contribute to the effective design and use of collaboration support and to the development of collaboration process design support. The research reported in this paper explores the strategies and techniques facilitators use to design a collaboration process, and the aspects of this task they perceive as challenging. We present the results of a questionnaire among professional facilitators. We compare facilitators with different expertise levels to identify challenges in the design of collaboration processes. We discovered that although the activities performed and information used by novices is not very different from expert practices, their limited experience makes them less flexible. When the actual session brings surprises such as different outcomes or conflict, novices cannot easily adapt their designs to accommodate these. © Springer Science + Business Media B.V. 2007.",Collaboration Engineering; Collaboration process design; Design and preparation; Facilitation; Facilitation techniques; Group support systems,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-34249941466

A river basin approach implies the integration of policymaking and management throughout a set of different functional uses and spatial scales. Another innovation of the Directive is the introduction of recovery of costs for water services, taking account of the polluter-pays principle. By 2010, water-pricing polices will have to provide adequate incentives for users to use water resources efficiently, and thereby contribute to the environmental objectives of the Directive. Other principles, such as the precautionary principle, are becoming increasingly important in the management of water resources as well. The translation of those principles into policy in the several Member States may however diverge. We present an overview of policy principles that play a role as basic assumptions in water management. Environmental policy principles have gradually been introduced in European legislation. From being part of a declaration of the Council, they have evolved to a basis for action in the environmental field and currently they also find wide application in the context of water management. While focusing on the EU Water Framework Directive, we investigate whether and how these principles can be reconciled with a framework for integrated water management. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

A categorization of these responses is given using which it is possible to formulate clear guidelines for further developments of standards for distributed simulation. © 2006 IEEE.",,Industry; Standards; Distributed simulations; In order; Surveys,Conference Paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-46149083044

This trend has given rise to a new research field: Collaboration Engineering. The goal of Collaboration Engineering is to design and deploy processes for high-value recurring collaborative tasks, and to design these processes such that practitioners can execute them successfully without the intervention of professional facilitators. One of the key concepts in Collaboration Engineering is the thinkLet-a codified facilitation technique that creates a predictable pattern of collaboration. Because thinkLets produce a predictable pattern of interactions among people working together toward a goal they can be used as snap-together building blocks for team process designs. This paper presents an analysis of the thinkLet concept and proposes a conceptual object model of a thinkLet that may inform further developments in Collaboration Engineering. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Respondents were also questioned about their willingness to pay for WIS and then- preferred WIS characteristics. In general, respondents were positive about WIS and were willing to spend an average of €3.17 [Eur 1 = U.S. $1.28 (2006)] per trip for its use.

For the majority of hydrocarbon production facilities, electric power is generated on-site, most often, by the combustion of some of the produced hydrocarbons. To optimize its performance, Shell is continuously looking at applying new technologies, which can increase the availability of her production facilities and/or reduced lifecycle costs and/or improve safety and environmental performance. Shell has identified fuel cell technology as being capable of delivering some of these benefits because of its potential to achieve high availability, reliability and fuel efficiency when compared to conventional technologies. An inventory has been made of the specific design specifications and the state-of-the-art of commercially available fuel cell systems. Most of the required capacities fall in the range of 1kW to 1 MW, which is compatible with state of the art fuel cell developments or it can be achieved in the near future. A software-screening tool has been constructed to evaluate the various options with respect to conventional technologies. The specific design specifications can vary from production site to site, but in general availability and low maintenance are two of the main criteria to be considered and most favorable for fuel cells. Depending on the specific requirements for a particular hydrocarbon production facility a polymer fuel cell, MCFC or SOFC system are considered suitable alternatives to conventional technology. The screening tool has been applied and evaluated in a case studyof one of the unmanned production facilities of Shell. A 20 kW SOFC system was found to score higher than a commercially available gas engine of 25 kW on eight of the most important of several criteria. However, SOFC system lifecycle costs are still 15 to 20% higher due to the development costs needed for this 'prototype' SOFC system to make it suitable for use in hydrocarbon producing facility. When applied in more surface production facilities the SOFC system also becomes costs competitive with conventional technologies.

The focal transform is introduced as a promising tool in data interpolation and noise removal, allowing the incorporation of macroinformation about the involved wavefields. From a physical point of view, the principal action of the forward focal operator is removing the spatial phase of the signal content from the input data, and the inverse focal operator restores what the forward operator has removed. The strength of the method is that in the transformed domain, the focused signals at the focal area can be separated from the dispersed noise away from the focal area. Applications of particular interest in preprocessing are interpolation of missing offsets and reconstruction of signal beyond aliasing. The latter can be seen as the removal of aliasing noise. © 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",Geophysical signal processing; Imaging; Interference suppression; Seismology; Signal reconstruction; Signal restoration,Bandwidth; Data processing; Image reconstruction; Imaging techniques; Interpolation; Signal reconstruction; Spurious signal noise; Inference suppression; Noise removal; Seismic bandwidth; Signal restoration; Seismology; data interpretation; focal mechanism; image analysis; imaging method; interpolation; seismic noise; seismology; signal processing; transform; wave field,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33751022437

If the differential moveout between primaries and multiples is small, prediction is the only option available. In the last decade, multidimensional prediction-error filtering by weighted convolution, such as surface-related multiple elimination (SRME), have proved to be very successful in practice. So far, multiples have been considered as noise and have been discarded after the removal process. In this paper, we argue that multiple reflections contain a wealth of information that can be used in seismic processing to improve the resolution of reservoir images beyond current capability. In the near future, one may expect that the so-called weighted-crosscorrelation (WCC) concept may offer an attractive alternative in approaching the multiple problem. WCC creates an option to avoid the adaptive subtraction process as applied in prediction-error algorithms. Moreover, it allows the transformation of multiples into primaries. The latter means that seismic imaging with primaries and multiples (nonlinear process) can be implemented by a sequence of linear processes, including the transformation of multiples into primaries and the imaging of primaries. © 2006 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",Imaging; Radon transforms; Seismic waves; Seismology,Acoustic noise; Acoustic wave reflection; Algorithms; Correlation methods; Image enhancement; Imaging techniques; Seismic waves; Multiple reflections; Prediction-error algorithms; Surface-related multiple elimination; Weighted-crosscorrelation; Seismology; algorithm; correlation; error analysis; imaging method; seismic reflection; seismic wave; seismology; theoretical study; transform,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-33748050798

Although there are a large number of modelling techniques to aid BP and IS design, there is little indication of which techniques can be suitable to model their integration. This research suggests a simulation model that can be used to depict BP/IS integration. Design/methodology/approach - The simulation framework proposed in this paper is based on a simulation framework used previously. For both frameworks, a single case study approach is employed for theory building and testing. The results provided by the application of the ASSESS-IT framework (theory testing) are used to propose the new ISBPS framework (theory building), which is tested again in the case study. Findings - The models derived from the ISBPS framework provide quantifiable metrics of the integration of BP and IS. These data can help analysts to foresee the benefits that the insertion of a given IS design may bring to the organisational processes. Research limitations/implications - The development of the ISBPS models proved to be complex. Further research should focus on testing the ISBPS framework with more complex IS and to provide mechanisms to facilitate their design. Practical implications - IS practitioners may consider simulation to evaluate IS design strategies.

Their complexity and evolution is difficult to manage. They lack flexibility. This contrasts sharply with system design in the batch-wise processing industry, where flexibility has always had a high priority. In this industry, the S88 standard plays an important flexibility-enhancing role. This paper compares the two fields of technology and explores which standards' characteristics increase system flexibility. It examines whether flexibility objectives in both fields differ and what constitutes a 'flexible standard'. Four standards' characteristics turn out to be important: degree of specificity, level of abstraction, system level, and degree of simplicity. These characteristics seem to be necessary for flexible systems, but whether they are sufficient cannot yet be said. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The extension of surface to internal multiples can be made by replacing shot records with common-focus-point (CFP) gathers, a CFP gather representing focused data with one source in the subsurface and all receivers at the surface (or vice versa for a receiver gather). The internal-multiple-removal algorithm can be formulated in terms of boundary-related and layer-related versions. In the boundary-related version, the internal multiples are removed for one downward-scattering reflector at a time. In the layer-related version, the internal multiples are removed for a sequence of downward-scattering reflectors at a time. An exact velocity model is not required, but proper muting is critical; muting becomes straight-forward in the CFP domain. The strategy for applying the two versions of the multiple-removal algorithm is demonstrated on physical-model and field data. One can conclude that the layer-related version is the most appropriate in most situations because it requires less user action and does not need exact knowledge of the multiple-generating boundary. © 2005 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.

We will illustrate this statement with a concrete example of engineers who design a truck's trailer and who do not think traffic safety is part of their responsibility. This opinion clashes with a common supposition that designers in fact should do all that is in their power to ensure safety in traffic. In our opinion this shows the need for a moral philosophy that helps engineers to interpret their responsibility and think more critically about it. For this purpose we will explore the moral philosophy of Alasdair MacIntyre, which is particularly interesting because he locates the beginning of moral thinking in the daily practice of a profession. This is consistent with the history of moral codes, for codes are also the product of moral reflection by professionals. We will use MacIntyre's philosophy to (1) explain what is wrong with the designers' understanding of their responsibility and (2) show a possible way to bring their reflection to a more self-critical level. We will also inspect MacIntyre's proposal critically. © 2005 Opragen Publications.",Engineering design; MacIntyre; Moral responsibility; Practices; Safety,"driver; engineering; ethics; Europe; government; history; injury; job analysis; law; legal aspect; marketing; model; morality; motor vehicle; occupation; organization; philosophy; research; responsibility; review; science; social aspect; traffic accident; traffic safety; article; engineering; organization and management; safety; traffic accident; Accidents, Traffic; Engineering; Moral Obligations; Safety",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-19444367508
